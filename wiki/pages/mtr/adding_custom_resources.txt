====== Adding Custom Resources ======

User-created content can be added to the Minecraft Transit Railway mod via resource packs. Currently, players can add the following:

  * Texture variants for existing [[/trains|trains]]
  * Blockbench models (BBmodel) for [[/trains|trains]]
  * New textures and/or text for [[/railway_sign|railway signs]]

It is highly recommended to be familiar with [[https://minecraft.wiki/wiki/Tutorials/Creating_a_resource_pack|creating a resource pack]] before proceeding with this guide.

===== Resource Pack Format =====

The file ''mtr_custom_resources.json'' is the main file that will get loaded. This file defines custom content for the mod to register. It must be placed under the ''mtr'' namespace; in other words, it must have the file path of ''assets/mtr/mtr_custom_resources.json''.

==== Adding Texture Variants for Existing Trains ====

To add texture variants, the ''custom_trains'' JSON object should be added to ''mtr_custom_resouces.json''. Each JSON object under ''custom_trains'', representing a texture variant for a train, should have a unique key and serveral required entries.

## Verifying the Resource Pack

Use a [JSON validator](https://jsonlint.com/) to check for any syntax errors of the JSON files.

The resource pack (zip file) can be installed either clientside or as a server resource pack. If installed as a server resource pack, all players joining the server will be able to see the new additions after accepting the server resource pack.

[Download the example resource pack](https://github.com/jonafanho/Minecraft-Transit-Railway/blob/master/examples/MTR%20Custom%20Resources.zip?raw=true) to see a full example and to test out the functionality.
