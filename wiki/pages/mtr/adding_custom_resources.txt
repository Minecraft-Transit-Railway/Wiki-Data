====== Adding Custom Resources ======

User-created content can be added to the Minecraft Transit Railway mod via resource packs. Currently, players can add the following:

  * Texture variants for existing [[/trains|trains]]
  * Blockbench models (BBmodel) for [[/trains|trains]]
  * New textures and/or text for [[/railway_sign|railway signs]]

It is highly recommended to be familiar with creating a resource pack before proceeding with this guide.

===== Resource Pack structure =====

This guide will tell you how to set up your file structure to make a resource pack.

Requirements: Windows 10 21H1 or later.

===== Guide =====

==== Folder structure ====

  - Go to your //.minecraft// folder. {{:mtr_extra:resourcepack:minecraft_folder.png?200&nolink}} 
  - Then find the //resourcepacks// folder {{:mtr_extra:resourcepack:screenshot_2023-05-16_211152.png?200&nolink}} 
  - Create a folder with a name that you want (for example: My custom M-Train) {{:mtr_extra:resourcepack:screenshot_2023-05-16_211341.png?200&nolink}}
  - Create a new folder inside of the existing folder called ''assets''. 
  - Upload a pack.png to your folder, this image will show in the resourcepack selection screen and should be 128x128.
  - Download this template pack.mcmeta and put it into your resourcepack folder:

<code json pack.mcmeta>
{
    "pack": {
        "description": "put your pack description here",
        "pack_format": 9
    }
}
</code>

<WRAP center round info 90%>

The pack format is what version of Minecraft the pack is for. If you are only adding MTR models or textures, this is not important. \\  However, if you feel the need to add a number, it is recommended to use 8 or 9, as they correspond to versions 1.18 and 1.19 respectively. \\  If a pack tells you it's "not compatible", just remember that the only thing that changes that is this number, so it really doesn't say much.

</WRAP>

  * Create a new folder named MTR in the assets folder.
  * Create a text file inside the folder named ''mtr_custom_resources.json''

==== JSON files ====

The main code for all custom resources is here:

<code json mtr_custom_resources.json>
{
    "vehicles": [],
    "signs": [],
    "rails": [],
    "objects": [],
    "lifts": []
}
</code>

==== Explanation ====

The file is quite self-explanatory; custom resources about trains, boat, cable cars and airplanes should be put under ''vehicles'', signs in ''signs'', and so on.

==== Note on Naming ====

By definition, Minecraft only supports the character set ''a-z'', ''0-9'', ''/._-''. This means characters such as uppercase letters **is not allowed and will not work**.

If it works on your Minecraft instance, it means you have installed some mods which explicitly bypass this behavior. However they do not work for other people without such mod, and you are discouraged from using these invalid characters as much as possible.

As such, make sure to **never** include uppercase letters in your filenames or the ids inside the resourcepack. Using them usually causes minecraft to ignore it and revert to the default texture.
