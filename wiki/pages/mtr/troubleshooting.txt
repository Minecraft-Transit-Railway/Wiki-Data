====== Troubleshooting ======

This page lists common issues with people either installing or using their mod, which may lead to incorrect behavior or game crash.

===== My game is crashing on launch =====

If you are using MTR 4, make sure that all the MTR addon mods you are using is compatible with MTR 4.

A notable case is the **Nemo Transit Expansion (MTR-NTE/NTE)** addon mod which has **NOT** been updated to MTR 4. Note that MTR 4 already integrated much of NTE's functionality (Such as optimization/OBJ rendering/Decoration Block), with the exception of **Scripting** and a few other cosmetic blocks.

===== Route Map is showing a black image =====

This may be due to your GPU not being able to handle displaying such a high resolution image, tuning the resolution down by following the steps below may help:

  - Go into a world
  - Obtain an [[mtr:dashboards|MTR Dashboard]] item
  - Right click on the dashboard
  - Click the **Options...** button at the bottom right
  - Find the **Dynamic Resolution** entry and turn the slider down
