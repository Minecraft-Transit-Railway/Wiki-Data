===== Usage =====

Dashboards will be opened when right-clicked.

==== Tabs ====

The Railway and Boat Dashboard has three tabs used to manage the railway.

<markdown>
















| Tab | Functionality |
| --- | --- |
| Stations | <li>Create a station with the `Add Station` button<li>Edit a station's name, colour, or area<li>Delete a station<li>List platforms in a station and edit the dwell time and platform number for each listed platform |
| Routes | <li>Create a route with the `Add Routes` button<li>Edit a route's name or colour<li>Add a platform to an existing route<li>Remove a platform from an existing route<li>Reorder platforms on a route<li>Delete a route |
| Depots | <li>Create a depot with the `Add Depot` button<li>Edit a depot's name, colour, or area<li>Delete a depot<li>List sidings in a depot and edit the siding number or train type for each listed siding |

</markdown>

==== Station / Route / Depot Name Field ====

When ''Add Station'', ''Add Route'', or ''Add Depot'' is clicked or when a station, route, or siding is being edited, the "name" field text box will appear at the bottom. Use the ''|'' character to separate different languages, for example ''第一城|City One''.

If left blank, the station or route will default to "Untitled".

Stations can be created and shared across all dashboards, but platforms, routes, sidings, and depots are only created and visible within the dashboard of the transport type.

==== Station / Route / Depot Colour Field ====

When ''Add Station'' or ''Add Route'', or ''Add Depot'' is clicked or when a station, route, or siding is being edited, the "colour" field text box will appear at the bottom, next to the "name" field. This text box accepts a RGB six-character hex code, composed of numbers or the letters A-F. Use a [[https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp|colour picker]] to easily generate a hex code.

If left blank, a random colour will be chosen.

==== Grouping Routes ====

Most of the time, a train line will have trains running in more than one direction. For example, a single line through a city will probably have trains running both outbound and inbound. In the game, an inbound and outbound route will have to be defined, creating two routes for a single line! Therefore, it is important to be able to group routes together.

When two or more routes share the same exact colour (same RGB hex code), they will be grouped together. On [[mtr:railway_sign]] and [[mtr:route_sign]], the routes will be grouped into only one line name.

Two pipe characters, ''||'', are used to add notes to the end of each route. The notes will not be shown in any signs; they will only appear in the dashboard.

It is recommended to have the same line name (before the ''||'') for routes that need to be grouped together. For example, two routes in the same group could be named ''東涌綫|Tung Chung Line||Westbound'' and ''東涌綫|Tung Chung Line||Eastbound''. If the line names are different, a random name will be chosen to be used on signs.

==== Using the Map ====

The map can be moved around by left-clicking + dragging the map, and can be zoomed in and out by using the mouse scroll or the + and - buttons provided.

==== Stations and Routes tab ====

When either the ''Stations'' or ''Routes'' tab is selected and while not editing a station or route, a platform on the map can be clicked on to bring up a platform configuration screen. The following properties for a platform can then be edited:

<markdown>

















| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Platform Number | <li>Generally, platforms in a station are numbered to reduce confusion for passengers.<li>Although uncommon in the real world, letters or even words can be used as the platform "number". |
| Dwell Time | <li>This determines how long a train should stop at the platform.<li>Generally, the value should be set to be low enough so that the next train would not arrive before the current train departs. |

</markdown>

==== Depots tab ====

=== Siding configuration ===

When the ''Depots'' tab is selected and while not editing a depot, a siding on the map can be clicked on to bring up a siding configuration screen. The following properties for a siding can then be edited:

^ Field ^ Description ^ Default value ^
| Siding Number | <li>Trains in a depot will be deployed according to the siding number</li>.<li>If two sidings have the same number, a random train between the sidings will be deployed. | 1 |
| Selected Vehicle | Vehicles that will be spawned in that siding. Click Edit to edit the formation. | N/A |
| Maximum Vehicles for Siding((
Not available for Cable Car Dashboard.
)) | Maximum number of formations of trains that can be spawned from that siding. | 1 |
| Vehicle Acceleration((
Not available for Cable Car Dashboard.
)) | Acceleration value for all formations of trains in this siding. | 4.0m/s² (14.4km/h/s) |
| Vehicle Deceleration((

| Increase Speed When Delayed((

)) | If the train is running behind schedule in ATO mode, the train will run at x% above the speed limit to try and running back on schedule. x=value set | 25% |
| Reduce Dwell Time When Delayed((
Not available for Cable Car Dashboard.
)) | If the train is running behind schedule in ATO mode, the train will reduce x% dwell time at each station to try and running back on schedule. x=value set | 100% |
| Wait at Platform When Early((
Not available for Cable Car Dashboard.
)) | If the train is running ahead of schedule in ATO mode, the train will stop at the station and wait until the expected departure time. | True |
| Drivable Vehicle((
Not available for Cable Car Dashboard.
)) | When turned on, the train will be able to operate manually by any player holding an appropriate Driver Key. | False |
| Maximum Drive Speed((
Not available for Cable Car Dashboard.
)) | Maximum speed that a train can reach in manual driving mode. | 300km/h |
| Drivable Timeout((
Not available for Cable Car Dashboard.
)) | When the ATO mode will kick in after any player on the train no longer hold an appropriate driver key. | 0 min 10.0 sec |

<WRAP center round important 90%>

If the siding is set to be a drivable vehicle, the value for **Maximum Vehicles for Siding** must be 1.

</WRAP>

== Selecting vehicles ==

By default, no vehicles are specified to spawn in a siding, even if it is within a siding. Players can press the + button to the right of each vehicle listed in the Available column to add a vehicle to spawn. Any vehicles that can't be spawned in that siding due to insufficient length will have a ⚠️ rendered before the name, and are unable to add to the Selected column.

In the Selected column, players can press Up / Down buttons to the right of each vehicles to change the order of the vehicles, or remove the vehicles from the list.

A "Duplicate Cars" option is available to allow players to duplicate the formation pattern.

=== Depot configuration ===

When the ''Depots'' tab is selected, and the player pressed the Edit (the pencil) button of a depot, the depot configuration screen is displayed. This is where the player can define the instructions for the depot.

^ Field ^ Description ^ Default value ^
| Schedule: Minecraft Time / Real Time | Schedule for when trains should depart from the depot. | Minecraft Time |
| 00:00-00:59 ~ 23:00-23:59 | Sliders for how many trains should depart from the depot per hour. | 0.0/hr |
| (Real time entering field) | Field for entering real-time schedule. The time should be entered in HH:MM:SS format. Adding +x*HH:MM:SS after the timestamp can add x more departures with a gap of the given time. | N/A |
| Depot name | Name of the depot. | Untitled |
| Depot Colour | Colour of the depot | Random HEX value |
| Edit instructions | Menu for editing instructions for all trains within the depot.  | N/A |
| Instant Deploy | Button for deploying all trains to the route instantly. | N/A |
| Refresh Path | Button for refreshing the paths of the instructions. | N/A |
| Clear vehicles | Button for clearing all trains of that depot that are out of the depot. | N/A |
| Repeat Instructions Forever | When enabled, all trains will repeat the instructions forever, without returning to the depot. | False |
