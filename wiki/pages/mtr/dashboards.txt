===== Usage =====

Dashboards will be opened when right clicked.

==== Tabs ====

The Railway and Boat Dashboard has three tabs used to manage the railway.

<markdown>

















| Tab | Functionality |
| --- | --- |
| Stations | <li>Create a station with the `Add Station` button<li>Edit a station's name, colour, or area<li>Delete a station<li>List platforms in a station and edit the dwell time and platform number for each listed platform |
| Routes | <li>Create a route with the `Add Routes` button<li>Edit a route's name or colour<li>Add a platform to an existing route<li>Remove a platform from an existing route<li>Reorder platforms on a route<li>Delete a route |
| Depots | <li>Create a depot with the `Add Depot` button<li>Edit a depot's name, colour, or area<li>Delete a depot<li>List sidings in a depot and edit the siding number or train type for each listed siding |

</markdown>

==== Station / Route / Depot Name Field ====

When ''Add Station'', ''Add Route'', or ''Add Depot'' is clicked or when a station, route, or siding is being edited, the "name" field text box will appear at the bottom. Use the ''|'' character to separate different languages, for example ''第一城|City One''.

If left blank, the station or route will default to "Untitled".

==== Station / Route / Depot Colour Field ====

When ''Add Station'' or ''Add Route'', or ''Add Depot'' is clicked or when a station, route, or siding is being edited, the "colour" field text box will appear at the bottom, next to the "name" field. This text box accepts a RGB six-character hex code, composed of numbers or the letters A-F. Use a [colour picker]([[https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp]]) to easily generate a hex code.

If left blank, a random colour will be chosen.

==== Grouping Routes ====

Most of the time, a train line will have trains running in more than one direction. For example, a single line through a city will probably have trains running both outbound and inbound. In the game, an inbound and outbound route will have to be defined, creating two routes for a single line! Therefore, it is important to be able to group routes together.

When two or more routes share the same exact colour (same RGB hex code), they will be grouped together. On [railway signs]([[https://github.com/jonafanho/Minecraft-Transit-Railway/wiki/Railway-Sign]]) and [route signs]([[https://github.com/jonafanho/Minecraft-Transit-Railway/wiki/Route-Sign]]), the routes will be grouped into only one line name.

Two pipe characters, ''||'', are used to add notes to the end of each route. The notes will not be shown in any signs; they will only appear in the dashboard.

It is recommended to have the same line name (before the ''||'') for routes that need to be grouped together. For example, two routes in the same group could be named ''東涌綫|Tung Chung Line||Westbound'' and ''東涌綫|Tung Chung Line||Eastbound''. If the line names are different, a random name will be chosen to be used on signs.

==== Using the Map ====

When either the ''Stations'' or ''Routes'' tab is selected and while not editing a station or route, a platform on the map can be clicked on to bring up a platform configuration screen. The following properties for a platform can then be edited:

<markdown>














| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Platform Number | <li>Generally, platforms in a station are numbered to reduce confusion for passengers.<li>Although uncommon in the real world, letters or even words can be used as the platform "number". |
| Dwell Time | <li>This determines how long a train should stop at the platform.<li>Generally, the value should be set to be low enough so that the next train would not arrive before the current train departs. |

</markdown>

When the ''Depots'' tab is selected and while not editing a depot, a siding on the map can be clicked on to bring up a siding configuration screen. The following properties for a siding can then be edited:

<markdown>















| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Siding Number | <li>Trains in a depot will be deployed according to the siding number.<li>If two sidings have the same number, a random train between the sidings will be deployed. |
| Train Type | <li>This determines what train type will be deployed from the siding. (Note that the siding must be long enough for the selected train type to spawn.) |

</markdown>

Stations can be created and shared across all dashboards, but platforms, routes, sidings, and depots are only created and visible within the dashboard of the transport type.
