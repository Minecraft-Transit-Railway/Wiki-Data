Escalators are multi-block structures that move players at a faster speed than sprinting. They are mainly built to go upwards or downwards, but they can also be built horizontally to create a moving walkway.

===== Obtaining =====

==== Breaking ====

Escalators require a [[https://minecraft.wiki/w/Pickaxe|Pickaxe]] to be mined, in which case it drops itself. When mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing. It has a [[https://minecraft.wiki/wiki/Breaking#Blocks_by_hardness|hardness]] of 2.

===== Usage =====

Building the escalator can be tricky. In the following series of images, the cursor points to the block where the next block should be placed against.

1. Obtain the escalator item and place it on the ground. This will be the bottom escalator landing.
