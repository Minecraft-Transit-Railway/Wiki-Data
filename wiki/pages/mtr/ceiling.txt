===== Usage =====

The placement direction of the ceiling block depends on the player orientation. The horizontal beams of the block will be placed parallel to the direction where the player is facing.

The ceiling without specifying light will have light when the x position((
When facing=false, i.e., north-south facing
)) or z position((
When facing=true, i.e., east-west facing
)) is a multiple of 3. Ceiling (Light) always has light while ceiling (no light) never has light.

===== Changelog =====

Unknown: Added.

%%Beta-8-prerelease-2: Dedicated ceiling blocks with light or no light is added, and the old ceiling block is now marked with "AUTO" in the icon.%%
