===== Usage =====

The platform block should be placed next to or one block away from a rail. It will orient itself automatically; the white strip will face towards air while the yellow line will face towards other solid blocks.

When [[/trains|trains]] arrive at a platform, the platform blocks by the rail will allow the train to open its doors.
