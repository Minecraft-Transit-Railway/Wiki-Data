The **Passenger Information Display System (PIDS)** is a block that will show the estimated time of arrival (ETA) of trains on a certain platform.

There are currently five types of passenger information display systems in the mod:

  * Type 1: Shows an animation and one train arrival.
  * Type 2: Shows the next three train arrivals.
  * Type 3: Shows the next two train arrivals, with the approaching train arrival in green.
  * Type 4: Vertical PIDS, Shows the next eight train arrivals.
  * Type 4-1: Vertical PIDS, Shows the next train arrival, and display all stops that it will stop.

===== Obtaining =====

==== Breaking ====

Passenger information display systems require a [[https://minecraft.wiki/w/Pickaxe|pickaxe]] to be mined, in which case it drops itself. When mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing. It has a [[https://minecraft.wiki/w/Breaking#Blocks_by_hardness|hardness]] of 2.

===== Usage =====

The passenger information display system automatically detects any  platform rail within four blocks horizontally and at most five blocks below.

If placed close to a platform rail and the platform has upcoming train arrivals, the train arrival's destination and estimated time of arrival (ETA) will be displayed.

If there are trains of different car lengths approacing the platform, the number of cars will be shown as well.

When right clicked with a brush, a custom message can be displayed. Custom messages can also be set to replace existing arrivals. Platform(s) in the same station can be also assigned, this will override the automatic detection.
