===== Usage =====

The route sign should be placed inside an existing station. Stations areas are defined with the [railway dashboard]([[https://github.com/jonafanho/Minecraft-Transit-Railway/wiki/Railway-Dashboard]]).

Right clicking the white portion of the route sign with a brush will bring up a selection screen of existing platforms in the station. Right clicking the black portion (at the top) with a brush will toggle the arrow directions.
