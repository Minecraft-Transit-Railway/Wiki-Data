The following message:

>歡迎光臨XXX站。Welcome to YYY Station.

will be shown in the chat upon right-clicking, if the tactile map is placed within a station area. XXX represents the CJK part of the station name, and YYY represents non-CJK part of the station name. If the station name consists of non-CJK characters only, only the English part will be displayed, vice versa. If the tactile map is not placed in a station, the tactile map will not output anything in the chat.
