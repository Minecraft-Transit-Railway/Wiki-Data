====== Cargo Loaders and Unloaders ======

Cargo Loaders and Cargo Unloaders are functional blocks in Minecraft. They are triggered with a train passing over them similar to the [[mtr:announcer|Announcer]] block and the [[mtr:redstonesensor|Redstone Sensor]] block.

===== Cargo Loaders =====

{{cargoloader.png?100x100&nolink |Image of a Cargo Loader}}The Cargo Loader works by placing down a chest on top of the cargo loader.

When a train carriage passes by the cargo loader it'll take 1 item from the chest and carries it until it touches a cargo unloader.

The chest can not be under the cargo loader since in Minecraft, you can't open a chest if there's a solid block on top unless it's a slab.

===== Cargo Unloaders =====
