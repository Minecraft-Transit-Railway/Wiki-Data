====== Cargo Loaders and Unloaders ======

Cargo Loaders and Cargo Unloaders are functional blocks in Minecraft. They are triggered with a train passing over them similar to the [[mtr:announcer|Announcer]] block and the [[mtr:redstonesensor|Redstone Sensor]] block.

===== Cargo Loaders =====

{{cargoloader.png?100x100&nolink |Image of a Cargo Loader}}The Cargo Loader works by placing down a chest on top of the cargo loader.

When a train carriage passes by the cargo loader it'll take 4 items max from the chest and carries it until it touches a cargo unloader.

The chest can not be under the cargo loader since in Minecraft, you can't open a chest if there's a solid block on top unless it's a slab.

===== Cargo Unloaders =====

{{cargounloader.png?100x100&nolink |An image of the Cargo Unloader block.}}The Cargo Unloader functions nearly the same as the [[mtr:cargoloader_unloader#cargo_loaders|Cargo Loader]] but the opposite way.

When a train carriage passes by the cargo unloader it'll put the item stored inside the carriage into the chest next to the cargo unloader, leaving the carriage empty.

Same thing, the chest can not be under the cargo unloader since in Minecraft, you can't open a chest if there's a solid block on top unless it's a slab.
