# Trains (Outdated)

As of version 3.1.2 of the mod, trains can only be spawned on sidings. They will run according to schedules and instructions in the depot. Sidings must have a length based on the following equation:

```
S = (L + 1)*C + 1
```

`S`: The length of the siding that must be built

`L`: The length of one carriage of the desired train type (see the table below)

`C`: The desired number of cars

# Types

There are currently eight different train types in the mod.

===== Behaviour =====

The train doors will open if there are [[/platform_block|platform blocks]] lining the platform. All train types must be boarded by walking onto the train. The train must be stopped at a platform to board passengers. Players can move around within the train car after boarding.

To alight, simply walk off the train when the train doors are open. In the case of an emergency, the player may press and hold the dismount key (left shift by default), just like dismounting any other vehicle in Minecraft.
