The station name blocks are decorative blocks that inform passengers of the name of the current station. There are four variants, two of which will show  the station colour as well.

===== Obtaining =====

==== Breaking ====

Each of the station name variants require a [[https://minecraft.wiki/w/Pickaxe|pickaxe]] to be mined, in which case it drops itself. When mined without a pickaxe, they will still drop itself. They have a [[https://minecraft.wiki/w/Breaking#Blocks_by_hardness|hardness]] of 2. For the station name (wall) and station name (entrance) block, if the block behind it is broken, the station name (wall / entrance) is dropped.

===== Usage =====

When any of the station name blocks are placed within a defined station area, they will display the station name. Stations areas are defined with any [[mtr:dashboards]]. When right clicked with a brush, the colour of the text and/or the style of the block will change.

The station name (wall), station name (tall wall), and station name (entrance) blocks are meant to be placed on the sides of other blocks. The station name (tall block) is freestanding.

The station name (tall wall) and station name (tall block) blocks are three blocks high. They will show the station colour if placed within a defined station area.
