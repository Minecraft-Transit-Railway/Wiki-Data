The station name blocks are decorative blocks that inform passengers of the name of the current station. There are four variants, two of which will show  the station colour as well.

===== Obtaining =====

==== Breaking ====

Each of the station name variants require a [[https://minecraft.wiki/w/Pickaxe|pickaxe]] to be mined, in which case it drops itself. When mined without a pickaxe, they will still drop itself. They have a [[https://minecraft.wiki/w/Breaking#Blocks_by_hardness|hardness]] of 2. For the station name (wall) and station name (entrance) block, if the block behind it is broken, the station name (wall / entrance) is dropped.

===== Behaviour =====

When any of the station name blocks are placed within a defined station area, they will display the station name. Station areas are defined with any [[mtr:dashboards]]. When right clicked with a brush, the colour of the text and/or the style of the block will change.

If the station text contains CJK characters, that part of the text will be rendered bigger than the other text.

If the station name is too long for the block to render, the text will be squashed or shrunk((
CJK text for all types of Station Name (Tall) only.
)) to fit in the block.

Station Name (Entrance) can be put next to each other and combined. This also applies to Station Name (Wall Text)

==== Rendering examples ====

| {{ :mtr:2025-12-10_16.29.54.png?200 }} |
|  Station Name (Wall Text), from left to right: white, grey, black.  |

| {{ :mtr:2025-12-10_16.31.40.png?200 }} |
|  Example of a Station Name being too long and text are squashed to fit in the block.  |

| {{ :mtr:2025-12-10_16.31.43.png?200 }} |
|  An extra Station Name (Wall Text) block is added to the right, and now the station name is rendered without being squashed.  |

| {{ :mtr:2025-12-10_17.06.58.png?200 }} |
|  Variations of Station name (Tall Block).  |

|  Variations of Station name (Tall Wall) and Station name (Tall Standing) respectively.  ||

|  If the Station Name block is not placed within a station area, "Untitled" will be displayed.  |
