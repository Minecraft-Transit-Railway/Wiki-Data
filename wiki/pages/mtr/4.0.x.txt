====== Minecraft Transit Railway 4.0 ======

Minecraft Transit Railway 4.0 is a major update to the Minecraft Transit Railway mod, succeeding MTR 3.2. In-place upgrade of existing MTR 3 world are available with minor quirks.

This releases focuses on refining the player experience, fixing numerous long-standing crashes and bugs, substantially improved frame-rate and adding long-requested features such as mixing carriage in a train.

The version is currently in development, and no public releases has been made.

===== Changes & Additions =====

==== Per-Carriage Configuration/Consist ====

Unlike previous versions where each depot siding can only have 1 train type, MTR 4 allows you to freely fill up a siding with other type of cars.

As an example, you can have an **SP1900 (Head), M-Train (Carriage) and K-Train (Rear Head)** to create a custom consist for your siding, and let that consist run on the track.

This is useful for mixed vehicle configuration (Such as coupled LRV with different phases), liveries and locomotives pulling other consists.

==== Rail Preview ====

Before placing a track connected to a node, an instant preview of what the track will look like would be displayed when holding the rail item.

==== Track Shape and Custom Model ====

Track shape and custom model can now be applied, this feature is incorporated from NTE.

==== New Trains ====

FIXME TODO

==== Horizontal/Diagonal Elevator ====

Elevator can now go vertically and horizontally at the same time, horizontal track are now added in addition to the already-existing vertical track.

==== Revamped System Map ====

The rewritten system map nows look better, runs faster and runs more reliably.

==== Signal Light ====

Signal lights can now be placed diagonally (In 22.5 deg increments). They can now also be filtered to only show the aspects of certain colored signals.

{{:mtr:mtr4_signallight.png?600|MTR Signal Light placed diagonally}}

==== OBJ Rendering ====

OBJ model has been incorporated from NTE and is now integrated into MTR 4.

This means MTR can now support detailed train/track models that are exported in the .obj format.

===== Notable Improvements =====

==== Distance Effect ====

Much of the [[https://minecraft.wiki/w/Distance_effects|Distance Effects]] has been mitigated in MTR 4. Railway facilities and trains will render correctly even in very high distances (i.e. Default world border), and [[mtr:dashboards|Dashboard]] will also function correctly with no precision loss when modifying an area.

==== FPS Lag ====

Rendering optimizations from the NTE Addon has been integrated to the **Minecraft-Mappings** project, which are also in-use by MTR 4.0. This should offer substantial frame-rate improvements during gameplay.((

))

==== Server Lag ====

The backend has been dramatically changed to no longer run on the Minecraft thread, which means the game loop is able to run faster, resulting in more consistent TPS/Lower MSPT.

The improvements is usually more visible in large-scale MTR servers with large transit networks.

==== Mod Compatibility ====

Major mod compatibility issue reported in MTR 3 is resolved in MTR 4, notable issues including:

  * Crash when making a boat depot (MrCrayFish Framework)((
[[https://github.com/Minecraft-Transit-Railway/Minecraft-Transit-Railway/issues/764|https://github.com/Minecraft-Transit-Railway/Minecraft-Transit-Railway/issues/764]]
))
  * Crash when opening the inventory (Botarium)((
[[https://github.com/Minecraft-Transit-Railway/Minecraft-Transit-Railway/issues/794|https://github.com/Minecraft-Transit-Railway/Minecraft-Transit-Railway/issues/794]]
))
  * Getting kicked out of rocket (Ad Astra)((
[[https://github.com/Minecraft-Transit-Railway/Minecraft-Transit-Railway/issues/427|https://github.com/Minecraft-Transit-Railway/Minecraft-Transit-Railway/issues/427]]
))
  * Invisible MTR Entity constantly seen when using JEI/The One Probe((

===== Technical Changes =====

FIXME This section should be removed later when the article is completed

==== Minecraft-Mappings ====

The [[https://github.com/Minecraft-Transit-Railway/Minecraft-Mappings|Minecraft-Mappings]] project has been rewritten, allowing for easier development between multiple Minecraft version and across modloaders. This replaces the need for **Architectury** for multi-platform, which were previously in use by MTR 3.

==== Rendering Optimizations ====

Rendering optimizations from the [[mtr_addon:nte:start|NTE Addon]] has been integrated to the **Minecraft-Mappings** project, which are also in-use by MTR 4.0. This should offer substantial frame-rate improvements during gameplay.((

==== Transport-Simulation-Core ====

On MTR 3, MTR is a self-contained mod responsible for handling everything from block configurations to simulation of the automated in-game network.

On MTR 4, the simulation part has been split off to [[https://github.com/Minecraft-Transit-Railway/Transport-Simulation-Core|Transport-Simulation-Core]]. This allows for easier integration of the network simulation part to another external application (i.e. Outside of Minecraft). The simulation now also runs on it's own dedicated thread when used with the MTR Mod, as such it can reduce Minecraft server lags caused by simulating the transit network.

===== Addon Compatibility =====

Due to the major backend rewrite, most if not all addons depending on the MTR Mod needs to be updated. A non-exhaustive list of addons can be found [[mtr_addon:start|here]], with MTR 3/4 tags appropriately applied to them.

Highly popular addons such as [[mtr_addon:lu:start|The Tube]] and [[mtr_addon:jcm:start|Joban Client Mod]] should already be available for MTR 4, with the exception of [[mtr_addon:nte:start|Nemo's Transit Expansion]], where much of the feature is already incorporated to the MTR Mod.
