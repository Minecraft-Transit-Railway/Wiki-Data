===== MTR 4.0 for Developers/Contributors =====

MTR 4 still have some issues / regressions introduced since MTR 3, which you can help the development of MTR 4 by contributing to such area.

==== Issues & Bugs ====

  * Train will not render with Sodium in MC 1.19.4 (Or Rubidium on MC Forge 1.20.1, switch to Embeddium in that case)
  * F3+T/lagging when riding a train will kick the player with ''Invalid move player packet received'' (Can repo in Singleplayer)
  * The resource pack creator cannot use non-alphanumeric characters such as CJK, and characters are garbled when exported.
  * Dynamic Texture generation could potentially fail (''java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke "java.awt.Font.deriveFont(int, float)" because "this.font" is null'')
  * Exception/Crash when loading rail model which points to an non-existent file
  * Built-in R-train is lacking some interior decoration
  * Sometimes certain train will be completely silent, then become normal again after riding the train for a period of time
  * F5-ing 2 times may result in the train rendering with the wrong rotation during curves
  * Some mod would result in vehicles getting speed up with shaders enabled

==== Non-blocking issues/bugs ====

  * Train announcement still gets played even when in-game sound volume is 0
  * Occlusion culling might be slow, causing trains & tracks to take a longer amount of time to show up (Resulting in train/tracks suddenly appearing out of nowhere, decreasing render distance helps)
  * BVE sound would get stuck if the train got occlusion culled
  * Rail model may occasionally flicker with a dimmed color.

==== Unimplemented Features ====

  * Ding Sounds in Elevator
  * Single Arrival Vertical PIDS
  * Scripting functionalities from Nemo Transit Expansion for MTR 3 (NTE)
