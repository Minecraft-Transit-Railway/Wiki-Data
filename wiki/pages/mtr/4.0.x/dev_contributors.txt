===== MTR 4 for Developers/Contributors =====

MTR 4 is still in active development, and there are some issues and features to be completed.

You can help the development of MTR 4 by contributing to such area.

==== Issues & Bugs ====

  * Train will not render with Sodium in MC 1.19.4 (Or Rubidium on MC Forge 1.20.1, switch to Embeddium in this case)
  * Vehicle Sounds are played multiple times when using shaders (Tested with Iris 1.7.2+mc1.20.4)
  * ** Custom destination for trains does not work reliably.**
    * Cannot find a way to reproduce reliably yet other than specific routes in a migrated world
    * Train's custom destination are displaying the custom destination from the furthest custom destination in specific route
    * Example: A route running from A to D.
      * If C has a custom destination, then train will always show C's destination even before reaching C
      * If D has a custom destination as well, then train will always show D's destination even before reaching D
  * Migration: NTE Rail flipped to the other side after upgrading to MTR 4.
  * Vehicle sounds cannot be overriden with BVE Sounds on custom trains with ''base_train_type''.
  * Train always open door when stopped with PSD/Platform block, even if it's not a stop in the route (Boardable)
  * F3+T when riding a train will kick the player with ''Invalid move player packet received'' (Can repo in Singleplayer)
  * Train bogie will disappear/appear in wrong position when riding train
  * The resource pack creator cannot use non-alphanumeric characters such as CJK, and characters are garbled when exported.
  * Clearing a depot's vehicle while onboard the train will cause the train to continue persist until the player gets off
  * Dynamic Texture generation could potentially fail? (''java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke "java.awt.Font.deriveFont(int, float)" because "this.font" is null'')

==== QOL/Low Priority ====

  * Train announcement still gets played even when in-game sound volume is 0
  * The model of the player riding train would shake, while the train render smoothly.

==== Unconfirmed issues/bugs ====

  * MTR 4 will significantly raise the temperature of some CPU Model causing a bottleneck
  * Sometimes certain train will be completely silent?
  * Solid color displayed for route map in terminating platforms/platforms without route. (Reproduced with Tianjin Metro Addon, haven't tried reproducing without it installed)

==== Unimplemented Features ====

  * Re-implement Manual driving
  * Hide Route not working on System Map
  * Missing Ding Sound in Elevator
  * Single Arrival Vertical PIDS not implemented

==== Shader Compatibility ====

Some of the known problematic shaders are listed below (MTR 4.0.0 beta.13):

| **Shaders** | **Issues with MTR** |
| Aurora's Shaders | Vehicle headlight texture is opaque (White background surrounding headlights) |
| Rethinking Voxels r0.1-beta-5 | ::: |
| ::: |   |
| Kappa v5.2 | Semi-transparent texture (i.e. Cyan Glass in SP1900) is washed out |
| Photon v1.0a | Semi-transparent texture (i.e. Cyan Glass in SP1900) is completely opaque |
| PotatoShaders v1.0d | ::: |

==== Other notes ====

Some custom door sound does not get played for whatever reason, to be investigated
