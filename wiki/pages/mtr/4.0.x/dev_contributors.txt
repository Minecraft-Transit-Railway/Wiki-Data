===== MTR 4.0 for Developers/Contributors =====

MTR 4 still have some issues / regressions introduced since MTR 3, which you can help the development of MTR 4 by contributing to such area.

==== Issues & Bugs ====

  * Train will not render with Sodium in MC 1.19.4 (Or Rubidium on MC Forge 1.20.1, switch to Embeddium in that case)
  * Train always open door when stopped with PSD/Platform block, even if it's not a stop in the route (Boardable)
  * F3+T when riding a train will kick the player with ''Invalid move player packet received'' (Can repo in Singleplayer)
  * The resource pack creator cannot use non-alphanumeric characters such as CJK, and characters are garbled when exported.
  * Clearing a depot's vehicle while onboard the train will cause the train to continue persist until the player gets off
  * Dynamic Texture generation could potentially fail (''java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke "java.awt.Font.deriveFont(int, float)" because "this.font" is null'')
  * Track signals would get cleared if edited with a brush
  * Exception/Crash when loading rail model which points to an non-existent file
  * Built-in R-train is lacking some interior model

==== QOL/Low Priority ====

  * Train announcement still gets played even when in-game sound volume is 0
  * The model of the player riding train would shake when in F5, while the train render smoothly.

==== Unconfirmed/Untested issues/bugs ====

  * Sometimes certain train will be completely silent?
  * Redstone sensors reportedly not working
  * Some mod/environment combination would result in train getting speed up with shaders enabled

==== Unimplemented Features ====

  * Manual driving (To be reworked after MTR 4.0)
  * Ding Sounds in Elevator
  * Single Arrival Vertical PIDS

==== Shader Compatibility ====

Some of the known problematic shaders are listed below (MTR 4.0.0 beta.16):

| **Shaders** | **Issues with MTR** |
| Kappa v5.2 | Semi-transparent texture (i.e. Cyan Glass in SP1900) is washed out |
| Photon v1.0a | Semi-transparent texture (i.e. Cyan Glass in SP1900) is completely opaque |
| PotatoShaders v1.0d | ::: |
