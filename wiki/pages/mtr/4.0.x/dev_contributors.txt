===== MTR 4 for Developers/Contributors =====

MTR 4 is still in active development, and there are some issues and features to be completed.

You can help the development of MTR 4 by contributing to such area.

==== Issues & Bugs ====

  * Train will not render with Sodium in MC 1.19.4 (Or Rubidium on MC Forge 1.20.1, switch to Embeddium in this case)
  * BVE Sound will no longer be able to play if the sound hasn't been played for 20 client ticks (Whether due to lag or other reasons)
    * Reinstating the train (Going out and back in the area) would fix the issue, but F3+T does not fix it.
  * Vehicle Sounds are played multiple times when using shaders (Tested with **Iris 1.7.2+mc1.20.4**)
  * Custom Destination for trains does not work reliably. (TBC, current observation includes different behavior for migrated/un-migrated world)
  * Migration: NTE Rail flipped to the other side after upgrading to MTR 4.
  * Vehicle sounds cannot be overriden with BVE Sounds on custom trains with ''base_train_type''.
  * Train always open door when stopped with PSD/Platform block, even if it's not a stop in the route (Boardable)
  * F3+T when riding a train will kick the player with ''Invalid move player packet received'' (Can repo in Singleplayer)
  * Train bogie will disappear/appear in wrong position when riding train
  * The resource pack editor cannot use non-alphanumeric characters such as CJK, and characters are garbled when exported.
  * Clearing a depot's vehicle while onboard the train will cause the train to continue persist until the player gets off

==== QOL/Low Priority ====

  * Train announcement still gets played even when in-game sound volume is 0
  * The model of the player riding train would shake, while the train render smoothly.

==== Unconfirmed issues/bugs ====

  * MTR 4 will significantly raise the temperature of some CPU Model causing a bottleneck

==== Unimplemented Features ====

  * MTR System Map's Direction Pane is incomplete.
  * Re-implement Manual driving
  * Hide Route not working on System Map
  * Missing Ding Sound in Elevator
  * Single Arrival Vertical PIDS not implemented

==== Shader Compatibility ====

Some of the known problematic shaders are listed below (MTR 4.0.0 beta.13):

| **Shaders** | **Issues with MTR** |
| Aurora's Shaders | Vehicle headlight texture is opaque (White background surrounding headlights) |
| Rethinking Voxels r0.1-beta-5 | ::: |
| ::: |   |
| Kappa v5.2 | Semi-transparent texture (i.e. Cyan Glass in SP1900) is washed out |
| Photon v1.0a | Semi-transparent texture (i.e. Cyan Glass in SP1900) is completely opaque |
| PotatoShaders v1.0d | ::: |

==== Other notes ====

Some custom door sound does not get played for whatever reason, to be investigated
