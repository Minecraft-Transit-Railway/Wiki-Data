===== MTR 4 for Developers/Contributors =====

MTR 4 is still in active development, and there are some issues and features to be completed.

You can help the development of MTR 4 by contributing to such area.

==== Issues & Bugs ====

  * Train will not render with Sodium in MC 1.19.4
  * BVE Sound breaks if player is outside loaded chunk (In per-car basis), where only a short period of sound is heard.
    * Reinstating the train (Going out and back in the area) would fix the issue, but F3+T does not fix it.
  * Vehicle Sounds are played multiple times when using shaders (Tested with **Iris 1.7.2+mc1.20.4**)
  * Action bar and destination shows the destination station's custom destination, instead of the next station's custom destination
  * NTE Rail flipped to the other side after upgrading to MTR 4.
  * Vehicle sounds cannot be overriden with BVE Sounds on custom trains with ''base_train_type''.
  * Elevator position is off on Minecraft 1.16.5
  * Train always open door when stopped with PSD/Platform block, even if it's not in the route (Boardable)
  * F3+T when riding a train will kick the player with ''Invalid move player packet received'' (Can repo in Singleplayer)
  * Train bogie will disappear/appear in wrong position when riding train

==== QOL/Low Priority ====

  * Train announcement still gets played even when in-game sound volume is 0
  * The model of the player riding train would shake, while the train render smoothly.

==== Unconfirmed issues/bugs ====

  * MTR 4 will significantly raise the temperature of some CPU Model causing a bottleneck

==== Unimplemented Features ====

  * MTR System Map's Direction Pane is incomplete.
  * Disable Next Station Announcement does not work
  * Re-implement Manual driving
  * Hide Route not working on System Map
  * Missing Ding Sound in Elevator
  * Single Arrival Vertical PIDS not implemented
