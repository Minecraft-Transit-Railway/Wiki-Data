===== MTR 4.0 for Developers/Contributors =====

MTR 4 still have some issues / features to be completed, which you can help the development of MTR 4 by contributing to such area.

==== Issues & Bugs ====

  * Train will not render with Sodium in MC 1.19.4 (Or Rubidium on MC Forge 1.20.1, switch to Embeddium in that case)
  * Custom destination for trains does not work properly after the 1st route.
  * Migration: NTE Rail flipped to the other side after upgrading to MTR 4.
  * Train always open door when stopped with PSD/Platform block, even if it's not a stop in the route (Boardable)
  * F3+T when riding a train will kick the player with ''Invalid move player packet received'' (Can repo in Singleplayer)
  * The resource pack creator cannot use non-alphanumeric characters such as CJK, and characters are garbled when exported.
  * Clearing a depot's vehicle while onboard the train will cause the train to continue persist until the player gets off
  * Dynamic Texture generation could potentially fail (''java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke "java.awt.Font.deriveFont(int, float)" because "this.font" is null'')
  * Solid color displayed for route map in terminating platforms/platforms without route

==== QOL/Low Priority ====

  * Train announcement still gets played even when in-game sound volume is 0
  * The model of the player riding train would shake when in F5, while the train render smoothly.

==== Unconfirmed issues/bugs ====

  * Sometimes certain train will be completely silent?

==== Unimplemented Features ====

  * Manual driving (To be reworked after MTR 4.0)
  * Hide Route not working on System Map
  * Missing Ding Sound in Elevator
  * Single Arrival Vertical PIDS
