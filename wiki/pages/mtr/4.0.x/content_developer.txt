===== MTR 4 for Custom Content/Trains Creator =====

This page documents some of the migration steps needed when loading MTR 3 custom content in MTR 4.

==== Javascript Scripting ====

JS Scripting from the [[mtr_addon:nte:start|Nemo Transit Expansion]] is **not implemented** at the moment. If you rely on contents that make use of such feature, you are advised to either stay on **MTR 3.x + Nemo Transit Expansion addon**, or explore with the new Resource Pack Creator in MTR 4 and see whether similar effects can be achieved.

==== mtr_custom_resources.json Changes ====

  * Train which uses a ''base_train_type'' but without providing ''texture_id'' no longer has base train's texture applied (Only transparent train with bogie & gangway)
  * Train which does not specify a valid ''gangway_connection_id'' (Or does not have it) can no longer walk between gangways like they can in MTR 3
  * When specifying built-in MTR barrier/gangway/vehicle texture, replace ''textures/entity/*'' to ''textures/barrier'', ''textures/gangway'' and ''textures/vehicle'' respectively, as they are now separated.

==== Custom Model Changes ====

  * **Custom Destination's CJK Ratio has been changed in MTR 4**
    * Previously, **-2.0** means English is bigger than Chinese, **0.0** for equal weight, **2.0** means Chinese is bigger than english
    * In MTR 4, this is changed to represent the scale CJK characters are rendered at:
      * Non-CJK characters always takes up a weight of **1.0**
      * For example, assume we have the text ''English1|中文|English2''.
        * If CJK Ratio is **2.5**, this would mean ''English''1 has a weight of **100%**, ''中文'' has a weight of **250%**, and ''English2'' has a weight of **100%**
        * If CJK Ratio is **0.1**, this would mean ''English1'' has a weight of **100%**, ''中文'' has a weight of **10%**, and ''English2'' has a weight of **100%**
