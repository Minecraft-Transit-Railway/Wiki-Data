====== Setting Simulation Time (POST) ======
Sync the Minecraft game time to Transport Simulation Core.

Note: The example endpoint sets the time for all dimensions at once, which is probably the desired behaviour.

[[https://github.com/Minecraft-Transit-Railway/Transport-Simulation-Core/blob/master/buildSrc/src/main/resources/schema/operation/setTime.json|Schema Reference]]
===== Example Endpoint =====
  http://localhost:8888/mtr/api/operation/set-time?dimensions=all
===== Field Explanation =====
  * ''gameMillis'': Milliseconds elapsed since midnight of the game time (e.g. ''300000'' for morning in Minecraft)
  * ''millisPerDay'': Total number of milliseconds of the game time (e.g. a Minecraft day is 20 minutes which is ''1200000'' milliseconds)
  * ''isTimeMoving'': Equivalent to the ''doDaylightCycle'' gamerule in Minecraft
===== Example Request Body =====
<code javascript>
{
    "gameMillis": 300000,
    "millisPerDay": 1200000,
    "isTimeMoving": false
}
