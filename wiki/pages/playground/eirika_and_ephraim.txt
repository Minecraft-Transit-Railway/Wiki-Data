===== In Let's Play Server =====

Both of them appears in the Let's Play server as decorations and easter eggs within the server. Eirika was first seen sitting against a tree in Flight Range Light Rail stop, and questioning if there is a world with only public transport.((
//I wonder if any of us will ever see a world that's full of light rail, buses, and free of saloon / sedan? //—Eirika
))

Another Eirika was seen in South Ferrus Island, asking visitors to help her with finding Ephraim and asking them to bring him to the station if they do so((
//Please do me the favour... I can no longer afford the price of a ticket... Please help me and find my brother Ephraim... ;( //—Eirika
)). She also tell the player about where they last met in Daeseong-ri, where Ephraim is also sitting on the platform, asking if they are aware of the presence of Eirika. Ephraim also express his concern about Eirika's safety, and Ephraim also expressed his concern about Eirika's safety, how she might (censored) if he failed to be in presence with Eirika, and also asking if the player can bring Eirika to him if they found her.((
