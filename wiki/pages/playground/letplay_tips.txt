=====About server connection errors=====
We will teach you about errors that can occur when connecting to a Let's Play server and how to deal with them.
====Registry remapping falid====
This error occurs when the MOD required for installation has not been installed correctly. In many cases, the [[mtr_letsplay:modpack|Modpack]] has not been installed correctly, so please check the Modpack installation procedure again.
====Connection reset====
This error generally occurs when the socket connection is closed by the other side. To resolve this, please check your internet and firewall settings, or try reconnecting after a while.
====Invalid Session====
This can sometimes be resolved by restarting Minecraft and the launcher as instructed by the error.
====You have been disconnected, the server has been shut down====
LPS will usually attempt to restart at 20:00 (UTC). You will be notified via chat about 5 minutes before. Please wait for a while and then reconnect.
