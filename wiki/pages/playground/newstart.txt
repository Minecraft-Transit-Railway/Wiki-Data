|  **Minecraft Transit Railway**\\ [[mtr:start|Minecraft Transit Railway]] is a Minecraft mod that adds the ability to create automated mass public transport systems. It is loosely based off of the Hong Kong MTR, the London Underground, and the New York Subway. It adds trains, boats, planes, and cable cars as well as blocks and facilities to allow the construction of massive transit stations. The mod is available for Forge and Fabric in select versions from 1.16-1.20.  |  **Let's Play Server**\\  The [[mtr_letsplay:start|Let's Play Server]] is a community Minecraft server coordinated on the MTR {{discord}} where builders build upon a continuously expanding network. The network is open to the public for visitors to explore, but if you want to become a builder, you have to join the {{discord}} and fill out an application.  |
