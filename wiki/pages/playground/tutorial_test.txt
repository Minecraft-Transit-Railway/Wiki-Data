====== Introduction to MTR Mod ======

{{:playground:mtr4_tutorial_test_dashboard.png?350}}

The **Dashboard** is one of the most fundamental items in the MTR Mod! In contrast to mods like **Create** which have minimal User Interface screens, MTR Mod have the requirements of managing large-scale automated transport networks, therefore it is important that players are kept in the loop about their the status of their network no matter where they are.

This is where **Dashboard** comes in. It is obtainable in the form of an Item (Either in the Creative Inventory, or Craftable in survival). When the item is used, it will open up a UI screen which shows all the station, routes and depots that has been created in this world.

==== Dashboard Types ====

While the MTR Mod has its origin around metro/trains, it also supports other transport types such as Boats/Planes. As such multiple types of **Dashboard** exists for each transport type.

**Rails** in MTR Mod is another fundamental concept, these are essentially tracks for train to run on. Unlike other train mod, each piece of track have a designated speed in which the automated train that is running on the rail will try to follow.

**But what about boat & buses you may ask?**

Rails are equally applicable to boats, planes and more! A better way to think of Rail is that **it is a path for automated vehicles to follow**. It is possible to change the appearance of a piece of rail by applying 3D model, or even without any model at all (an invisible path), which makes it suitable for transport types like buses & boats.

We'll go through on how to connect these rails later!
