====== Introduction to MTR Mod ======

{{:playground:mtr4_intro_goal.png?350|Goal}}

Before starting, it is important to recognize the primary goal of **Minecraft Transit Railway**.

First and foremost, MTR primarily caters towards building **transit networks** in Minecraft that are designed to **run autonomously, on-time and with predictability**, all without the need of manual interventions by players. This means that while each MTR update will bring more sophisticated simulation details & mechanics, having extremely accurate and realistic vehicle simulation mechanics is not a primary goal of the mod nor something that the mod actively aims for.

This also means that MTR empowers player with easy to use tools to oversee & manage their transit network effectively, this deviates from some other mods with the focus of mechanics and interactions directly within the Minecraft world.

Sounds good? Let's dive in!

The **Dashboard** is one of the most fundamental items in the MTR Mod! In contrast to mods like **Create** which have minimal User Interface screens, MTR Mod have the requirements of managing large-scale automated transport networks, therefore it is important that players are kept in the loop about their the status of their network no matter where they are.

This is where **Dashboard** comes in. It is obtainable in the form of an Item (Either in the Creative Inventory, or Craftable in survival). When the item is used, it will open up a UI screen which shows all the station, routes and depots that has been created in this world.

==== Dashboard Types ====

While the MTR Mod has its origin around metro/trains, it also supports other transport types such as Boats/Planes. As such multiple types of **Dashboard** exists for each transport type.

**Rail** in MTR Mod is another fundamental concept, it is essentially a track for trains to run on. Unlike most other train mods, each piece of track have a designated speed in which the automated train that is running on the rail will try to follow, rather than the other way around (Train having it's own speed limit)

**But what about boat & buses you may ask?**

Rails are equally applicable to boats, planes and more! A better way to think of Rail is that **it is a path for automated vehicles to follow**. It is possible to change the appearance of a piece of rail by applying 3D model, or even without any model at all (an invisible path), which makes it possible to cater towards different transport types like buses & boats.

We'll go through on how to connect these rails later!
