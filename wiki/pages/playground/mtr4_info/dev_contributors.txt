===== MTR 4 for Developers/Contributors =====

MTR 4 is still in active development, and there are some issues and features to be completed.

You can help the development of MTR 4 by contributing to such area.

==== Issues & Bugs ====

  * BVE Sound breaks if player is outside loaded chunk (In per-car basis), where only a short period of sound is heard.
    * Reinstating the train (Going out and back in the area) would fix the issue, but F3+T does not fix it.
  * Action bar and destination shows the destination station's custom destination, instead of the next station's custom destination
  * NTE Rail flipped to the other side after upgrading to MTR 4.
  * Custom Destination Display not parsed correctly

==== Unconfirmed issues/bugs ====

  * Can't get BVE Sound working with the legacy resource format? (To be investigated)
  * MTR 4 will peak the CPU to 100% with certain CPU Model
  * Elevator rendering will be off with certain mod combination

==== TODO ====

  * Train schedule does not account for when TSC (MTR back-end) is shut-down.
  * MTR System Map's Direction Pane is incomplete. (WIP in[[https://github.com/Minecraft-Transit-Railway/Transport-Simulation-Core/pull/6|#6]])
  * Disable Next Station Announcement does not work
  * Re-implement Manual driving
  * Re-enable MTR Font toggle (For non-dynamic texture)
  * Hide Route not working on System Map
  * Missing Ding Sound in Elevator
  * Single Arrival Vertical PIDS not implemented

==== Other notes ====

Some custom door sound does not get played for whatever reason, to be investigated
