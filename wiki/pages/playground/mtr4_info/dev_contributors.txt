===== MTR 4 for Developers/Contributors =====

MTR 4 is still in active development, and there are some issues and features to be completed.

You can help the development of MTR 4 by contributing to such area.

==== Issues & Bugs ====

  * BVE Sound breaks if player is outside loaded chunk (In per-car basis), where only a short period of sound is heard.
    * Reinstating the train (Going out and back in the area) would fix the issue, but F3+T does not fix it.
  * Vehicle Sounds are played multiple times when using shaders (Tested with Iris **1.7.2+mc1.20.4**)
  * Action bar and destination shows the destination station's custom destination, instead of the next station's custom destination
  * NTE Rail flipped to the other side after upgrading to MTR 4.
  * BVE Sounds cannot override a sound with ''base_train_type''.

==== Unconfirmed issues/bugs ====

  * Can't get BVE Sound working with the legacy resource format? (To be investigated)
  * MTR 4 will significantly raise the temperature of some CPU Model causing a bottleneck
  * Elevator position is off on Minecraft 1.16.5

==== TODO ====

  * MTR System Map's Direction Pane is incomplete. (WIP in[[https://github.com/Minecraft-Transit-Railway/Transport-Simulation-Core/pull/6|#6]])
  * Disable Next Station Announcement does not work
  * Re-implement Manual driving
  * Hide Route not working on System Map
  * Missing Ding Sound in Elevator
  * Single Arrival Vertical PIDS not implemented

==== Shader Compatibility ====

Some of the known problematic shaders are listed below:

| **Shaders** | **Issues with MTR** |
| Complementary Reimagined r5.3 | Vehicle headlight texture is opaque (White background surrounding headlights) |
| Complementary Unbound r5.3 | ::: |
| Aurora's Shaders | ::: |
| Rethinking Voxels r0.1-beta-5 | ::: |
| ::: |   |
| Kappa v5.2 | Semi-transparent texture (i.e. Cyan Glass in SP1900) is washed out |
| Photon v1.0a | Semi-transparent texture (i.e. Cyan Glass in SP1900) is completely opaque |
| PotatoShaders v1.0d | ::: |

==== Other notes ====

Some custom door sound does not get played for whatever reason, to be investigated
