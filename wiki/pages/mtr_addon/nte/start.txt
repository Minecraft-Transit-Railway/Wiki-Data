# NTE: Nemo's Transit Expansion

NTE (Nemo's Transit Expansion) is a mod that includes a number of experimental expansion features to buttress the usability of the Minecraft Transit Railway mod. Developed by [Zbx1425 (also known as Nemo)](https://www.zbx1425.cn), a contributor for the main MTR mod, the mod aims to showcase the creator's ideas and features within an addon mod. The mod is planned to be merged into the main MTR mod at some point in the future. The mod enhances the core functionality of the MTR mod and allows for testing of the experimental features before said eventual merge. The MTR mod can be found on [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/minecraft-transit-railway) as well as on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/minecraft-transit-railway).

 The mod was initially debuted at [Teacon 2022 模组开发茶会](https://www.teacon.cn) under the name "MTRSteamLoco". It received the honour of “癫火之王” at the convention. In fact, the name "MTRSteamLoco" remains in the mod's internal name, as all blocks have the prefix "mtrsteamloco:".

## Features

NTE has a number of notable features, including but not limited to：

- 3D multifaceted track rendering, including resource pack support for custom track models
- New built-in trains: Japanese D51 steam locomotive and Beijing Subway DK3 class train, featuring detailed wheel and train crew animations created using NTE's dedicated backend code.
- Support for importing OBJ models, and assisting resource pack creators in designing more intricate models. These can be imported both as vehicle models (trains, planes, etc.) or placeable objects using the "Decoration Object" item in game.

- There are also a number of features that aid in video production, most notably the ability to hide the train on which you are riding. A number of videos have been made using this feature, [including ones made by Jonathan Ho](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt-uRkJ08o), the creator of the MTR mod.

Make sure to refer to the page on the mod's [Features](feature) for more information. (**Read carefully!**).



## Download

Please refer to the [Downloads](download) page.

Please note that, when using OBJ-modelled trains that are imported via NTE's resource pack support, players who do not have NTE installed clientside will not be able to view said resource pack-imported trains.



## Resource Pack Creation

- NTE features support for importing OBJ models into the game

  NTE provides support for OBJ models to be imported into MTR using NTE's dedicated backend. With the new enhanced rendering capabilities, it offers improved performance for the client whilst reducing lag, even when using highly detailed models with high triangle counts.  For more information, please refer to the [OBJ Importation Guide](objschem).
