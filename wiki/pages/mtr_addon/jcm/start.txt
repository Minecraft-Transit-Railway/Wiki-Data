It is no longer being developed as development work moves on to v2.

===== Version 2 Series =====

The Version 2 Series is a completely rewritten version of Joban Client Mod, with the version number starting from **v2.0.0**, with the hopes of being easier to maintain, add features, and be more lightweight.

It is based on the rewritten version of the [[https://github.com/Minecraft-Transit-Railway/Minecraft-Mappings|Minecraft Mappings]] project (Also used by MTR) to provide cross-version and modloader compatibility.

It has not been officially released as development is still in progress, the release date is targeted to be the same as [[mtr:4.0.x|MTR 4.0.0]] if time allows.
