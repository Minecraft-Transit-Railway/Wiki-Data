When you finish your train model, there's no point in adding it into a resource pack and calling it a day, and expecting the game to magically understand your logic. It is not impossible to write up all the definitions and properties by yourself, but the complication will certainly make you feel overwhelmed. Resource Pack Creator is designed to allow you to create custom trains, boats, cable cars, and aeroplanes with a live preview, making the process of creating a resource pack easier for everyone.

===== Dependencies =====

  - A web browser, such as Google Chrome. In MTR4 Resource Pack Creator runs as a website hosted on your computer, so you will not find the Resource Pack Creator item in your Creative Mode Inventory.
  - Models and textures, if you're going to start from scratch.
  - A resource pack, if you're going to edit an existing resource pack.

===== Create New Resource Pack =====
