====== User - dankdanc ======

===== Abstract =====

The user in question is a member of the MTR Discord community with a nickname that represents what should be the way. Dude's a regular train talker and founding member of ASEAN's MTR charter. He's a Formula 1 fan, follower of Hololive et al (and incognito fan of some) ((
 Oh, he likes puns too. Maybe gives a clue on who he's an incognito fan of.
)), talks lots of random stuff, and relatively regular train talker. Outside of MTR he has a parallel and different life, being an aspiring engineer ((
Contrary to popular belief - and his nickname - he is not interested to pursue professional status.....yet, at least.
)), music enjoyer, meme knower and stuff. Likes numbers and stat data occasionally, so if you want to know the ridership of RapidKL's lines and their station usage, then hit me up or something.

> "And I have become joke, the destroyer of regular humor" - Probably me according to some IRL people.

===== Introduction =====

Even in Engineering, it takes a while to perfect something. Even as we speak something is cooking in this space.

So I hope that what is written so far gives an overview of the person behind the name. Yeh.

UPDATE: I would no longer be able to cook. Due to new regulations adopted as of 27 January, this page would cease to exist on the 30th of January at the soonest.
