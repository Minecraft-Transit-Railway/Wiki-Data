====== Mainline Railways ======


Mainline Railways, originating in United Cities Railways (UCR), was established on the 1st January 2024. However, on 18th January 2024, Mainline Railways expanded to Cascadia. Mainline Railways operates a few lines and makes a few buildings across Cascadia and UCR, mostly following a metro style for train routes and a semi-modern style for city buildings. Mainline Railways follows a reasonably realistic style for train usage, tunnel and station design.
