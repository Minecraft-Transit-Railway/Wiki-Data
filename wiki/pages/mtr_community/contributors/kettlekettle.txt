====== User - kettle ======

{{ :mtr_lp:kettl_es_fingers.png?200}}Hi, I'm kettle, an MTR mod user from New Zealand who added two blocks to the mod, built some stuff on the let's play server and nearly modeled a train in Blockbench. I've used MTR mod since 2016, played mincefart since late 2011 or early 2012, never beaten the game and hosted a server for about ten months. I may some day post a video on youtube.

here's an octopus
