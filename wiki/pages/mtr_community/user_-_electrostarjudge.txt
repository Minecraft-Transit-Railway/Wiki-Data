**ElectrostarJudge** is a staff member in the [[mtr:start|Minecraft Transit Railway]] Discord community. He joined in December 2021 and became a member of the Staff Team as a Moderator in July 2022, before subsequently being the final person promoted to Staff before the Moderator role was dissolved and merged with the Staff role. Electrostar started out as just a member of the Centralia server, where his friendship with HistoryButt and [[mtr_community:autobusfahrer|autobusfahrer]] began, before the unfortunate demise of the now mych missed Centralia. Electrostar also owns the namesake operator Electrostar Rail, his first large project, Great Western, a regional suburban project, as well as CrossCountry, an InterCity style service operating across a number of other lines on the [[mtr_letsplay:start|Let's Play Server]] to connect cities in the similar style to the real life [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrossCountry|CrossCountry Trains]] operator.

Electrostar is British, and therefore has a decent knowledge of UK trains, which he can often be found giving incredibly biased opinions on or firing off random photos of trains into the #train-talk channel of the discord. As well as this, he's also into motorsport, especially sportscars, and can sometimes be located in #off-topic complaining about the teams he supports getting taken out or retiring, and lauding praise on them if they get a good result.

===== Let's Play Server =====

**Electrostar Rail**

Electrostar Rail was the first major project Electro worked on within the Lets Play Server. The operator runs alongside Riverside Line services between Llanmara St Devota and Benfleet stations, before venturing out to Ilford Island via Kirkenkessie Gateway. Some services are diverted from Llanmara St Devota to Hampton West after Winbeck, as well as having an additional station call at Red Creek. These trains provide local connections to DLR routes from Kirkenkessie Bank station, as well as for High Speed services to Einsburg Central & Twyford. It also provides a shuttle service between Ilford Island and Ilford Parkway, connecting Overground trains with the Wilds Railway Hoku-Hoku Line, Einsburg Line, Wadern Branch and mainline Electrostar Rail services.

**Great Western**

Great Western is a project that provides a regional suburban service between New Victoria and Marylebone, via Ridgeside North & Wanborough. Only trains booked for Class 150 units can call at Ridgeside North owing to platform length limitations, and the operator platform shares with Overground services to Pawtecket and Ridgeside Line services to Denthrope at New Victoria. The line also shares tracks with CrossCountry services between Marylebone and Wanborough. Class 171 "Turbostar" units also work the line, with the diagrams split evenly between Sprinter and Turbostar sets.

**CrossCountry**

CrossCountry, or XC in it's short form name, operates long distance services across the Let's Play map, starting with services from Einsburg Central to Zuidbaai, via Marylebone and Denthrope Hauptbahnhof. The operator uses Diesel-only Class 802 units, as it does not always work across electrified lines, and Hitachi's bi-mode reliability is too poor for the operator to utilise the overhead line equipment where it is available. In future, it is hoped to massively expand the XC network, via collaboration with other builders and to operate joint services with their respective Operating Companies.

===== Reskins =====

"I often make reskins, taking real world liveries and giving them fictional applications on UK trains. From the BR423 recieving South West Trains' Suburban colours, to Ã–BB's RailJet scheme transferred onto an 802, or the CrossCountry IETs in Virgin guise as well as Arriva, I like reskinning!" Below are (will be) some of the liveries Electrostar has brought onto new canvases in the form of uniquely repainted units

===== Fun Electrostar Facts =====

Electrostar's current favourite train is the 1976-built High Speed Train, formed of Class 43s and Mark 3 Carriages, not Class 375s, 376, 377s, 378s, 379s or 387s!

His favourite colours are neon pink and neon green, because he likes bright, bold colours!

Electrostar is a regular parkrunner, having racked up over 250 Volunteering and running instances combined. He's also an enthusiastic squash player, battling out of mediocrity into semi competent gameplay!

Electrostar can speak German so well that it baffles native speakers of the language!
