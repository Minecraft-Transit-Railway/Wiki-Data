====== Builder applications ======

The builder applications are open for a certain week every single month. Non-builders may choose between 2 applications, depending if they've previously worked on another server or not. Once they pass the applications, they will move on to the builder test. Builder tests usually consist of a prompt that the individuals will need to build, if they pass the builder test they become a builder in the server.

====== Reception ======

The reception of this server in the MTR Discord is mixed. Some say it is a good place to start their MTR careers, others make fun of it for its unrealistic parts, notably its floating tracks and undecorated stations, making the server notorious for its lower-than-usual building requirements compared to other bigger MTR servers, such as [[mtr_community:server:district_of_joban|District of Joban]].
