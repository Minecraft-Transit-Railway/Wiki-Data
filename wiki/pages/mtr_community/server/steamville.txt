Steamville is a MTR server focused on utilising both the MTR mods, Create mod and lots of decoration mods such as chipped. It sports a large and well connected map and a small but dedicated community. It is generally differentiated from other servers for offering less of a ‘vanilla’ experience, allowing for greater creative freedoms.
