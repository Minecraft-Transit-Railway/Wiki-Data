Steamville is an MTR server focused on utilising both the MTR mods, Create mod and lots of decoration mods such as chipped. It sports a large and well connected map and a small but dedicated community. It is generally differentiated from other servers for offering less of a ‘vanilla’ experience, allowing for greater creative freedom.

==== Trivia ====
Steamville was initially for resource pack sharing and did not have a server, however in March 2024 the Minecraft server was created.
