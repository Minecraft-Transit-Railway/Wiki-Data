===== History =====

The founder (Yannis) started being passionate about trains around 2023. Since then, he has done many rail related activities. He slowly started becoming a huge rail enthusiast and started looking for something where he could fulfill his dream of driving trains and managing a railway. After he found the MTR mod, he began working. He never got too far, as he always quit after doing just one or two lines. But this time, he decided that he can not quit. He realised that he always quit due to being bored. So he found EpicFlynn and they started building.

=== Info ===

Verdonia State Railway is the currently only operator in Verdonia. It currently runs all the railway services in the country. This line first started out with the Metropolitan Line but now also runs the Mint Line and future lines. This operator is mostly a Regional/Suburban Rail operator meaning that it won't go far from its base at Porchester City.
