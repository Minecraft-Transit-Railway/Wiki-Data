===== History =====

The City of [[mtr_community:server:centralia|Centralia]] originally started out as Central & Suburbia, and the names were merged to create [[mtr_community:server:centralia|Centralia]]. The central [[mtr_community:server:centralia|Centralia]] city area is made up of a merger of two former independent cities by the names of Haruna and Sendai, of which you can still see the names in a few stations, such as Haruna Shrine and Sendai Tower. Originally, it was a 1.7.10 singleplayer Minecraft world using the RealTrainMod, but as the world evolved and the Minecraft version was updated, it was transferred from RealTrainMod to the [[mtr:start|Minecraft Transit Railway]] mod it uses today. An advantage of this change was that rails now supported 45 degree rotations, and an old trace of the 90 degree-limited track beds is still visible between Banks Heath and Selsdon Bridge, now Sendai Parkway stations, which coincidentally sported the first railway connection. Years later, it was opened as a server, with multiple users working on railways within the world at once, which significantly boosted the development of the city. Many buildings built by others are still visible to this day, even after the server was unfortunately closed down due to internal disputes between Vako and [[mtr_community:server:centralia|Centralia]] staff members at the time. The world kept developing for a while after, and in early 2023, reopened once more to a selected group of active and trusted people. Unfortunately, due to multiple different factors, mainly including a lack of motivation, the server was once again closed and the project was immediately put on an indefinite hiatus. The state in which the server closed was released as [[mtr_community:server:centralia|Centralia]] version 1.1.5, also known as the EOD (End Of Development) release. However, interest remained high in the eyes of other members, including szandorthe13th, who transformed his discord server, which was previously in a zombie state from the former Moszyan Railways server it ran, into a server dedicated to finishing the work he had started on [[mtr_community:server:centralia|Centralia]] in the short time he had access to the server. He would stay in contact with Vako, receiving lots of useful information and assistance in his continuation of the project. Eventually, because of the significantly higher activity on this originally unaffiliated side-project, and around the opening of this very wiki you are reading from right now, szandorthe13th recieved the green light to fully step into the role of representing the [[mtr_community:server:centralia|Centralia]] project. However, to prevent confusion between the two versions of [[mtr_community:server:centralia|Centralia]] that had split from each other by now, szandorthe13th's version would be known as "Szandor's Centraliaverse", as every person who downloads the map and starts their own journey on it, creates their own Centraliaverse, so to speak. In early 2024, talks began to merge the Centraliaverse map back into the still-in-development main Centralia map.

=== Info ===

Centralia Rail is a publicly owned rail company which serves the Central and Suburb areas of Centralia City and Hibiki Prefecture. It is focused on overground trains, but also owns the underground Central & Junction Line to connect the two main transport hubs of the Central area. It is the second oldest active operator in Centralia, only being outdated by Centralia Metropolitan Rail. As a result of this age, a lot of its lines have changed services over the years, with some being extended, rerouted, or sometimes even shortened. After selling off the Maids Moreton Line to Moszyan Railways, Centralia Rail has mainly being focusing on extending its existing lines to regions outside of the Central and Suburb area.

=== Info ===

Centralia Metropolitan Railway Company is wholly owned subsidiary of Centralia Transport, a Transit Authority which runs services within Centralia City and Hibiki Prefecture including Metro trains, Light Metro trains, Light Rail trains and Buses. It is the oldest operator in the area, essentially stemming from the former Haruna & Sendai City Railway, of which you can still see the typical station buildings along the Lakeside Line. Some of its lines are still incomplete, and there are a lot of remnants of old lines left over to this day. Recently, Centralia Metropolitan Railway Company collaborated with Moszyan Railways to create a new underground line connecting the new Lower Centralia area to the centrepoint at Great Central.

=== Info ===

The Warrington Flyer wasn't really an operator, but more a system of lines under no real ownership. The system was seen by many as arbitrary, with most of the line serving no real purpose apart from the branch to Warrington Pond. The lines lost their last bit of usefulness when Rhodes Cross was constructed, located just 150 metres west of Warrington Pond station, which stands isolated in a forest.
The system is abandoned, and no longer operational.

=== Info ===

The Rhosyngardd City Council is a Open Access Rail Operator only operating trains for tourism. Their lines typically branch out from Rhosyngardd Central. RCC is known for being the only ones to have put up a serious restriction in the world, which is to keep trains from entering the Rhosyngardd City walls at all costs. They used to operate light rail in the Hibiki area, but after RCC Tramways merged with AIRL to create the Centrewest network, all that remains is a few B90s with RCC livery on the Centrewest Green Line.

=== Info ===

The Centrewest Light Railway (not to be confused with  Centrewest Buses), is a light rail operator in Western [[mtr_community:server:centralia|Centralia]] operated by Centralia Transport formed by the merger of RCC Tramways and Armour Island Light Railway. While most of the Armour Island Light Rail's route was preserved, now as the Centrewest Blue Route, RCC Tramways had its system completely demolished and reworked from the ground up. The Centrewest Light Railway consists of four routes, which all meet at Hibiki station. The Green Route, due to its path, runs two services, one between the depot at Gull Ruins and Headstone, and one between Headstone and Rhosyngardd Central.

=== Info ===

Moszyan Railways is the youngest operator in the city of [[mtr_community:server:centralia|Centralia]], being the only currently active one created in 2023. It was created after szandorthe13th took over the Maids Moreton Line from Centralia Rail to extend it and turn it into a full line. This line would end up being the Trident Line. Due to this identity, the operator originally had called itself "Trident Railways" as well. This can still be seen on the EOD release of [[mtr_community:server:centralia|Centralia]], where the Trident Line is referred to with the prefix "TR". After construction of Mayrowe Central, with new signage for all of the previous stations on the line, it was officially renamed to Moszyan Railways. Moszyan Railways also co-owns the section of the Eula Line between Garbeck and Anemone Bay, as the extension of the line moved the sidings over to the TMT Complex, which happens to be Moszyan Railways' headquarters.
