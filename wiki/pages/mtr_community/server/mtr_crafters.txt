**MTR Crafters** is a Minecraft server that uses the Minecraft Transit Railway mod to recreate the Hong Kong MTR System (and possibly the city itself) in a 1:1 scale. It has a strict standard, where builders would build stations according to their real looks by site visits, photos taken and videos recorded by other Youtubers. This provides stations with accurate locations and facilities, and make sure the stations look realistic while passengers taking the MTR in the server.

==== History ====

Before MTR Crafters was founded, Kinson Studio already made a public Minecraft Vanilla Server named MCMTR, which features 1:10 ratio of HK map and MTR stations. However the development of MCMTR was getting slower after the opening of Tuen Ma Line in June 2021. Kinson needed new ideas to attract more users and keep his reputation. Bosco invited Kinson to create a new server together, featuring 1:1 scale of HK Map using MTR Mod.

The server was created when the founder of Centown, Bosco, with inspector Jonathan and server administrator Isaac, decided to join forces with Kinson Studio Community to recreate MTR in Minecraft. The staff team in MTR Crafters is a mixture of both servers. However, due to Centown's inactivity, adding the arrival of Let's Play Server, MTR Mod Community is no longer a partnership with Centown. MTR Crafters had switched the main partnership to the official Minecraft Transit Railway mod server and had broke off our partnership with Centown, meaning Kinson is now the only remaining owner of the server. 

The server originally used 1:2 map of HK due to technical issues generating an actual 1:1 map. But that map was put to an end after 1 year of hard grinding by spdfNerd and isaaclao, the 1:1 map was officially implemented on 27/12/2022. In 1:2 Map, it original decided to use 4-car platforms instead of 8-car platforms, in order to fit the actual map size. However it is built as 8-car platforms at last, and decided to move stations' schematics to 1:1 server directly.

This server was a partnership with Stellania's server, raised by Bosco. However partnership server is inactive till now.
