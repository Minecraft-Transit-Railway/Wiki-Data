====== Introduction ======

The City of Sallen is an American-based city server which had recently expanded to include metro from all over the world. The server has many reputable areas along with new and growing developments.

==== Glossary ====

When reading this article, readers may encounter the following terms, conveniently defined here to avoid confusion:

  * **Old Sallen: **The oldest version of Sallen City, did not have MTR installed, a superflat world, and only three companies
  * **New Sallen:** Sallen's most notable world; it was used from 5/31/23-12/6/23 after a mod corrupted, breaking the world
  * **Sallen 2: **The current world of Sallen, six main boroughs (Lakeshore, Clinton, Newton, Hillside, St Blythe & Elizabeth, Ile Calin

==== History ====

The Sallen City known today originally started out as a Roblox server, by the name of [[https://www.roblox.com/groups/9122249/Victoria-County-Transportation-Authority#!/about|Victoria Country Transit (VCT)]]. VCT was primarily developed by agentdevv (@BlazaTheMan), f29/LTDelTaco (@AbandonedCrew), Fries (@Sir_MMK), and others now moving on to other projects. It created ROBLOX((
%%Roblox is %%a global platform where millions of people gather together every day to imagine, create, and share experiences with each other in immersive, user-generated 3D worlds%%. The types of gameplay on Roblox are just as limitless as the imagination of the creators themselves. (source: %%[[https://corporate.roblox.com/parents/#:~:text=What%20is%20Roblox%3F,imagination%20of%20the%20creators%20themselves|What is ROBLOX?]])
)) Bus & Train games loosely based off the MTA Subway .

Sallen City was originally a private, vanilla server. The map itself was a superflat, with many areas of the city being filled with villages. Liberty Plaza, Fort Yasuko, and Lakeshore all originated from this version of Sallen, commonly referred to as "Old Sallen."

Old Sallen was created on April 14, 2022. It was owned by agentdevv (@agentdevv on discord), and was a server where only agentdevv, BostonianBoy (also known as SirMMK) and LTdelTaco (also known as f29) played.

Old Sallen is a beloved version of Sallen City and is used to show the difference between the current server and the original server. Old Sallen was converted to use MTR, but unfortunately, Aternos' corrupted the file and nothing saved (aternos moment jajaja). On May 31st 2023, this led to the creation of current Sallen City, a version called "Country of Sallen" which has since been reverted to Sallen City.

Modern-day Sallen City is a large step forward from Old Sallen. The MTR mod was the focal point of the server, allowing systems to become more complex than their Old Sallen counterpart.

=== Old Sallen Railways ===

Old Sallen had three different transportation systems, even before MTR. The original three goes as followed:

- Sallen City Transit (SCT) by **agentdevv** - Sallen Metro Transportation (SMT) by **starjunction**

- Sallen City Regional Transportation Authority (SCRTA) by **Sir_MMK**

===== Sallen City Transit =====

==== Introduction ====

Sallen City Transit, or SCT was the oldest company in Sallen City, owned by **agentdevv** and **apache**. Sallen City Transit is heavily inspired and based off the MTA Subway<sup>1</sup> While most IRT and IND lines are developed by **agentdevv**, **apache** is tasked with constructing the BMT lines.

==== History ====

In Old Sallen, Sallen City Transit was the most efficient way to transport in Sallen City. Stopping in densely populated areas of Sallen, it was a very reliable system. All stations had unique (SUBJECTIVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) designs and feel, as well as the routes being more organized and simple to navigate.

When modern-day Sallen was created (5/31/23), two now-abandoned stations were created to serve a proposed line: North Beach and Breen K. Sallen Road.

SCT was the first system created on the New Sallen server, with the Hamilton Blvd Lines (A)(C) being the first lines on the server [Fort Yasuko <-> Edgeword]. Now, SCT is expanding faster than ever, with many new lines being created to provide Sallen with fast and reliable service.

===== SMART Transit =====

%%SMART Transit was one of the first rail companies in New Sallen. The company was founded on May 30th of 2023 by Sir_MMK. SMART Transit hosts the Sallen Ferry, SallenRail Transportation and the SMART LRT. The first section of the LRT opened in June 2023, between Newton Docks and Newton-City Terminal. Further extensions would open in the following months. The LRT extensions prior to the Grand Shutdown ran parallel to SCT and ApacheRail (now shutdown). %%

==== New Sallen ====

On July 7th, 2023, the LRT Great Northern line would open, making 19 stops between Bloomington Village and Westfield Airport (previously Northwest Klein Airport). The (B) and the now closed (D) lines served the Great Northern Local, while the (A) served Great Northern Express, bypassing most stations as a skip-stop service.

After careful consideration by Sir_MMK, the (D) line was later closed, as it did not serve an additional purpose to the (E) and caused overcongestion on the Great Northern.

%%In July 2023, SMART made a project to rebuild Newton Terminal. This project would lead to the Grand Shutdown in September of the 2023. The Grand Shutdown for the LRT was from September of 2023 to December of 2023. The LRT would be closed in its entirety for heavy improvements. More realisitic tunnel walls, extended platforms, improved stations, and catenary systems were all added during the four month shutdown. %%

In August 2023, SMART Transit and Sallen City Transit collaborated to start constructing new lines: the SMART (C) making local stops, and the SCT (L) making express stops to Stelham Haven. After other projects were prioritized however, these lines' development were halted and have yet to receive attention again.

%%SMART Ferry would open in Late Summer of 2023 between Old Village Pier and Newton Docks. The Old Village Ferry was extended in August of 2023. This would bring it to the small village of Devinstown served by SMT. The Old Village Ferry was renamed to the F1 with this change. The F2 would open due to the Grand Shutdown on the LRT. This route runs between Newton Docks and Little Village Pier.%%

===== Sallen Metro Transit =====

==== New Sallen ====

Sallen Metro Transit, or SMT was one of the four original companies in new Sallen (SCT, SMART, SMT, ApacheRail), mainly operating services in Clinton. It was created and now owned by [[:starjunction]], also one of the three builders in Old Sallen.

Initially, lines were given two different names based off the direction they were going in, similar to how [[wp>Grand_Theft_Auto_IV|GTA IV]]'s metro system worked. The (1) was named the 1/2, the (2) was named the 3/4, the (3) was named the 5/6, and so on and so forth.

In July 2023, the SMT 5/6 (now the 3) lines were constructed from Liberty Plaza to Wabash, stopping at Devinstown, Barnesville, Riverton Village, Great Plains, Holyoke, Edgeword, and Wabash. This was the only SMT line (before the merge) to go north of and not primarily serve Clinton. __Underlined Text__In August 2023, the SMT 11/12 (now the 6) was finished, codenamed the "Great Plains Loop". This line served now-major transit hubs such as Great Plains, Myrtle-Kennedy, Maple Park, and the Nexus Promenade. This

==== ApacheRail (New Sallen) ====

ApacheRail was the fourth original company in New Sallen, owned by apache. It was created in Early-June, with provisions for three lines to be constructed: X, Y, and Z. All three lines would terminate at Great Plains, running right under the SCT Hamilton Lines. In Mid-June, ApacheRail purchased two abandoned stations from SCT in Lakeshore, named North Beach and Breen K. Sallen Road. North Beach was renamed to Downtown-Lakeshore to avoid confusion with the SMART Transit station.

ApacheRail's development was split into phases, with a total of 9 phases before its shutdown. After Breen K. Sallen Road, Phase 2 began construction to Sallen Pier on the X Line, stopping at Sallen International Airport, Hillside, Woodmere, Oceanside, Boardwalk, and Sallen Pier. Boardwalk was later abandoned due to the close proximity to Sallen Pier. ApacheRail featured a unique feature that no other company utilized: Custom Announcements. These were used on the W, X, Y, and Z lines before they were phased out on the V line.

In Early-August, proposals were created to expand ApacheRail to handle higher capacity, creating 4 more phases. Phase 6 proposed an extension North of Great Plains to Winstree, served by the proposed U and Z lines. After completion of this project, attention was lost to ApacheRail as [[mtr_community:apache|apache]] started utilizing the B&C mod and collaborated with SCT (Sallen City Transit). ApacheRail was eventually sold off to [[mtr_community:starjunction|starjunction] and SMT.
