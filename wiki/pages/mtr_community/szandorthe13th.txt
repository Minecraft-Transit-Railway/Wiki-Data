==== Introduction ====
Hello! I'm **Szandor**! I'm one of the more active members in the [[mtr:start|Minecraft Transit Railway]] community, my goal is to help people, but my task sometimes seems to be acting as the voice of reason in a group of people. You might know me from the [[https://discord.com/channels/763273460465270816/953329579567767572/1133230266463293471|RNET Stadler FLIRT 3]] skin I published in the public resourcepacks channel, but you will probably also know me as the guy who hasn't stopped yapping about [[mtr_community:centralia|Centralia]] since the day I joined the project.

You will find me working on [[mtr_community:centralia|Centralia]], but I can also be found on the servers of Helensburgh, United Cities Railways and [[mtr_community:sallen-city-server|Sallen City]]! On these servers you can see my generally neutral, but sometimes Western-European building style.

I have also seemingly become known around the place for my love for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One|Formula 1]] and [[https://virtualyoutuber.fandom.com/wiki/Hololive|Hololive]] V-tuber [[https://virtualyoutuber.fandom.com/wiki/Tokoyami_Towa|Tokoyami Towa]]. The last more visible, as it has become more prevalent on my profile lately, as I originally only had an animated banner of a snippet of the music video of one of her original songs [[https://youtu.be/TfOx00AOfKo?si=2aBxJcK4YTxZZqlM|Raimei]], but by now I have an [[https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lIL2gF8EYHi4dYBHs0pTl-wRKOUgB0jKI|Aster]] profile picture, an [[https://youtu.be/G3J06ircgMA?si=ijzlhizqC1kkl9_M|Anemone]] banner, as well as a very common use of Towa emotes and status messages.

I encourage you to strike up a conversation with me, and please don't turn the reply ping off, because I'm on a LOT of servers and might not see your message.

==== History ====
I have always had some sort of interest in trains, but it never really came up until me and a few friends started a server using the Create mod. This is where I created my first-ever train station called **Windacre**.
The server was however lost through a short-lived conflict with the owner, and shortly after, I discovered the Minecraft Transit Railway mod.
In a singleplayer world, I build my first-ever MTR station by the name of **Pondem Village**. After this I spent many nights working on the amazing Greenfield map to make its existing transit systems work.
Singleplayer was getting boring after this, and after knowing and having watched Jonathan's tutorial videos to learn how to set everything up in the Greenfield save, I joined the discord server on the 2nd of January 2023.
My first message was a rather creepy "there always that voice in your head chanting JUMP. JUMP. JUMP. JUMP." on the 7th of January.
I was looking for a server to build on, and since I was very new to the mod at the time, I looked upon finding a server with a low entry bar.
This server would end up being Caston, which I joined on the 19th of January.
Unfortunately Caston never saw much activity, and all that happened was me extending the mainline from Spawn to a new station called Desert Oasis.
Because of that, and via one of the server's members, I joined Helensburgh, which had greater aspirations at the time.
On the first world, I became known for the small area I had built with railways through stations by the names of **Dalry, Cirrane, Cirrane East, Crescent Mangrove, Dornwich, Windermere, Aysgarth, Pinella Pass, Mansion, Eelry and Croydon-Lewes**.
Unfortunately the first server came to an end in an attempt to put new systems in place to better regulate railway lines and country areas. This idea never took off as activity became very low due to the server's constant modpack and performance issues. In my attemps to help with the country system, I became a mod, then staff, then a manager.
Somewhere along the way, on the 27th of February, I discovered United Cities Railways
