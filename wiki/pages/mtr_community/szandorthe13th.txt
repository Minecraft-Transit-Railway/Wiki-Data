Hello! I'm **Szandor**! I'm one of the more active members in the [[mtr:start|Minecraft Transit Railway]] community, my goal is to help people, but my task sometimes seems to be acting as the voice of reason in a group of people.
You might know me from the [[https://discord.com/channels/763273460465270816/953329579567767572/1133230266463293471|RNET Stadler FLIRT 3]] skin I published in the public resourcepacks channel, but you will probably also know me as the guy who hasn't stopped yapping about [[mtr_community:centralia|Centralia]] since the day I joined the project.

You will find me working on [[mtr_community:centralia|Centralia]], but I can also be found on the servers of Helensburgh, United Cities Railways and [[mtr_community:sallen-city-server|Sallen City]]! On these servers you can see my generally neutral, but sometimes Western-European building style.

I have also seemingly become known around the place for my love for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One|Formula 1]] and [[https://virtualyoutuber.fandom.com/wiki/Hololive|Hololive]] V-tuber [[https://virtualyoutuber.fandom.com/wiki/Tokoyami_Towa|Tokoyami Towa]]. The last more visible, as it has become more prevalent on my profile lately, as I originally only had an animated banner of a snippet of the music video of one of her original songs [[https://youtu.be/TfOx00AOfKo?si=2aBxJcK4YTxZZqlM|Raimei]], but by now I have an [[https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lIL2gF8EYHi4dYBHs0pTl-wRKOUgB0jKI|Aster]] profile picture, an [[https://youtu.be/G3J06ircgMA?si=ijzlhizqC1kkl9_M|Anemone]] banner, as well as a very common use of Towa emotes and status messages.

I encourage you to strike up a conversation with me, and please don't turn the reply ping off, because I'm on a LOT of servers and might not see your message.
