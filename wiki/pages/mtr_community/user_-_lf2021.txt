LF2021 is a MTR Mod builder who is interested in building metro systems. I have been building systems using the MTR Mod since November/December 2022, however most of those systems have since been deleted due to operational failures or just my general boredom of doing nothing but building metro systems. My passions outside the MTR Mod are riding real-life public transport (WMATA Metrorail/Metrobus and Montgomery County Ride-On Buses), riding Elevators, and commercial aviation.

What projects I am doing currently:

LF2021 Metro-Construction of Line A

PLEASE NOTE-I may not be online at all times, due to personal reasons or due to academic reasons.
