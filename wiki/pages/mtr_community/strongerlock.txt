==== Before Joining MTR Community ====

**Stronger** has showed interest in Minecraft as early as in 2018, when the Minecraft Pocket Edition was popular. He tried and built small scales of train stations and routes in his first private server, and this engaged his interest in minecraft railways.

In 2020, Kinson Studio created a public server for Bedrock/Pocket Edition for MCMTR in 2020. **Stronger** joined the discord community in April 2020 and became a builder there. He and Kinson created a new MCMTR Series, 【KS MCPE MTR 伺服器 Server – 車站重建計劃 Station Rebuild Project】, and rebuilt several stations along Tung Chung Line, Airport Express and Disneyland Resort Line. He became one of the original staff team.

In early 2021, MCMTR is upgraded to a Java Server, with plugins allowing BE/PE users to join. Stronger bought Java Edition and started to discovering java mods/plugins.

In April 2021, with the invitation of Centown Owner, Bosco, **Stronger** joined Centown community and became a staff there. He joined MTR Community  afterwards and became first 500 members.

==== After Joining MTR Community ====

**Centown Periods**

**Stronger** has actively paid efforts in Centown Server, building Jonathan Line, JonExpress (/JonaExpress), and helping [[mtr_community:Forest_E233|Forest]] to rebuild Mystic Tong Ming Line. He built roads nearby railways and opened several bus routes in the soutern areas. He contributes to the Phases system in Centown Station, making the guidelines clear for visitors.

Unfortunately, in 2022 July, the network adapter of the machine Centown was hosted broke down in an OS update. Twinkle, the highest of Centown management, had to launch the planned new map of Centown Centown NXT early to all builders.

Stronger visited once the Centown NXT server after released to all builders, and was permitted to test curve platforms in the south of Hongye under permissions. However there are chaos in Centown, adding the builder credits raised by Twinkle, he did not plan to build large-scale lines.

Unfortunately, the server wasn't doing good in reliability. Very few builders transitioned to the Centown NXT and some treated it as the experimental base for other projects9). Also the only service getting out of Spawn Area owned by Twinkle10) was heard to be unstable and often jammed up. Due to Centown NXT being chaotic soon after the launch, Stronger decided to focus on MCMTR and acadmics.

**Let's Play Periods**

Stronger was invited to be a part of Let's Play Members in August 2022. He proposed to build in the soutern areas and founded Yankton. He built Snowie Line, Snowtral Line, Wanton Line and Los Sants Line. However due to the big lag in Let's Play Server, he became inactive in Let's Play Server between April to December 2023, and started focusing on MTR Crafters.

**MTR Crafters Periods**

In September 2021, **Stronger** joined [[mtr_community:server_-_mtr_crafters|MTR Crafters]] and became an Admin. However due to acadmic studies, Centown workload and map issues in MTR Crafters, he is inactive until 2023.

During 1:2 Map Period, Stronger tried investigating curve platforms, and build temporary tracks in Central Station, However the plan was failed due to overscaling. He had to think alternative plans.

After 1:1 Map is released in October 2022, Stronger thought a new idea on curve platforms, which only Island Line platforms are curve while Tsuen Wan Line platforms are straight, and it solved the problem found in 1:2 map. In June 2023, Admiralty Station and Central Station started its first progress in 1:1 Map. This made Stronger became active again in MTR Crafters.

Project Lantau Island Railways started after the opening ceremony of West Rail Line. Stronger is the main builder of the project and aimed to build accurately. Tung Chung Line and Disneyland Resort Line is opened to public in 12 August 2023.

Admiralty Station is mainly finished in 31 December 2023.
