**StrongerLock1268** aka **Stronger**, is one of the staff in the [[mtr:start|Minecraft Transit Railway]] Discord community. He is also one of the builders and the founder/PIC of [[mtr_letsplay:yankton_railway|Yankton Railway]] (YNM) and [[mtr_letsplay:los_sants_pacific_airways|Los Sants Pacific Airways]] (SL/LSP) in the [[mtr_letsplay:start|Let's Play server]]. 

==== Before Joining MTR Community ====

**Stronger** has shown interest in Minecraft as early as 2018 when the Minecraft Pocket Edition was popular. He tried and built small-scale train stations and routes on his first private server, which further engaged his interest in Minecraft railways.

In 2020, Kinson Studio created a public server for Bedrock/Pocket Edition for MCMTR. **Stronger** joined the Discord community in April 2020 and became a builder there. He and Kinson created a new MCMTR Series, 【KS MCPE MTR 伺服器 Server – 車站重建計劃 Station Rebuild Project】, and rebuilt several stations along the Tung Chung Line, Airport Express, and Disneyland Resort Line. He became one of the original staff members.

In early 2021, MCMTR was upgraded to a Java Server, with plugins that allowed BE/PE users to join. Stronger purchased the Java Edition and started discovering Java mods/plugins.

In April 2021, with the invitation of Centown Owner, Bosco, Stronger joined the Centown community and became a staff member there. He then joined the MTR Community and became one of the first 500 members.

==== After Joining MTR Community ====

**Centown Periods**

**Stronger** has actively made efforts in the Centown Server, building the Jonathan Line, JonExpress (/JonaExpress), and assisting [[mtr_community:Forest_E233|Forest]] in rebuilding the Mystic Tong Ming Line. He constructed roads near the railways and established several bus routes in the southern areas. He also contributed to the Phases system in Centown Station, clarifying the guidelines for visitors.

Unfortunately, in July 2022, the network adapter of the machine hosting Centown broke down during an OS update. Twinkle, the highest-ranking member of Centown management, had to launch the planned new map of Centown, called Centown NXT, earlier than anticipated for all builders.

After the release of Centown NXT to all builders, **Stronger** visited the server once and was granted permission to test curve platforms in the south of Hongye. However, due to the chaos in Centown, exacerbated by the increase in builder credits initiated by Twinkle, Stronger did not intend to construct large-scale lines.

Regrettably, the server's reliability was poor. Only a few builders transitioned to Centown NXT, while others treated it as an experimental base for other projects. Additionally, the only service outside of the Spawn Area owned by Twinkle was known to be unstable and frequently jammed up. Due to the chaotic state of Centown NXT shortly after its launch, Stronger decided to focus on MCMTR and academics.

**Let's Play Period**

In August 2022, **Stronger** was invited to join the Let's Play Members. He proposed to build in the southern areas and founded Yankton. He constructed the Snowie Line, Snowtral Line, Wanton Line, and Los Sants Line. However, due to significant lag on the Let's Play Server, he became inactive between April and December 2023 and shifted his focus to MTR Crafters.

**MTR Crafters Period**

In September 2021, **Stronger** joined [[mtr_community:server_-_mtr_crafters|MTR Crafters]] as an Admin. However, due to academic studies, Centown workload, and map issues in MTR Crafters, he was inactive until 2023.

During the 1:2 Map Period, **Stronger** attempted to investigate curve platforms and build temporary tracks in Central Station. However, the plan failed due to overscaling, and he had to consider alternative plans.

After the release of the 1:1 Map in December 2022, Stronger came up with a new idea for curve platforms, where only Island Line platforms are curved while Tsuen Wan Line platforms remain straight. This solved the problem encountered in the 1:2 map. In June 2023, Admiralty Station and Central Station made their first progress in the 1:1 Map. This reactivated Stronger's involvement in MTR Crafters.

The Project Lantau Island Railways commenced after the opening ceremony of the West Rail Line. Stronger served as the main builder for the project, aiming for accuracy. The Tung Chung Line and Disneyland Resort Line were opened to the public on August 12, 2023.

Admiralty Station was mostly completed by December 31, 2023.
