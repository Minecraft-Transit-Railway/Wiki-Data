Jasmien is one of the ex-staff members of the MTR Discord. She was responsible for moderation across the Discord as well as management of smaller aspects of the server like the monthly banner vote.

Jasmien started building on bigger projects like MetroCAD and Centralia when these first appeared.

She was focusing more on the Discord server and the experience for the community. You can rarely see a glimpse of her in the Letâ€™s Play. Jasmien is also fluent in German. If you have inquiries, questions, or complaints but can only voice them in German, she is happy to help and answer questions.
