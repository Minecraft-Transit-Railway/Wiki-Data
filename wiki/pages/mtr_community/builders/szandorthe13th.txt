**Szandor** is one of the more active members in the [[mtr:start|Minecraft Transit Railway]] community, his goal is to help people, but my task sometimes seems to be acting as the voice of reason in a group of people.

He's most known for his [[https://discord.com/channels/763273460465270816/953329579567767572/1133230266463293471|RNET Stadler FLIRT 3]] skin published in the public resourcepacks channel, as well as the MTR community's equivalent of the rickroll where any mention of Boskoop or anything related to the railway line running through it will result in receiving the "get boskoop snijdelwijk'd" gif as reaction, the reason for it being that [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boskoop_Snijdelwijk_railway_station|Boskoop Snijdelwijk]] is often joked about as a useless station due to it seeing the lowest passenger numbers in the region despite 7.5 minute train frequencies.

On [[mtr_community:server:centralia|Centralia]] he works on helping the map develop, adapting his builds to the existing ones somewhat, and on [[mtr_community:server:unitedcitiesrailways|United Cities Railways]] he works on making sure the system is accurate to the map and that odd ideas don't spiral out of control. 

With his company [[mtr_letsplay:mrw|Moszyan Railways]] you can also find him on the [[mtr_letsplay:start|Let's Play]] server! There, he plans to make use of his local references to make a system that operates like he is used to at home, while still fitting the style of the server itself.
