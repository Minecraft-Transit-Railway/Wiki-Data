Jonas is one of the builders of the[[mtr_letsplay:start| Let's Play Server]]. He's currently involved in the [[Elizabeth line|Elizabeth line]] project.

Jonas started building in autumn 2022 with the Elizabeth line platforms at [[mtr_letsplay:sw_plains_station|SW Plains]].

He is also a former Staff member of the MTR Discord Server, but stopped working in this role as the work moderating the server was too much for him.

These days, he focuses more on his real-life working experience. Sometimes he can be spotted on the Let's Play server when he continues to build on his projects. Jonas's native language is German. If you have inquiries, questions, or complaints but can only voice them in German, he is happy to help and answer questions.
