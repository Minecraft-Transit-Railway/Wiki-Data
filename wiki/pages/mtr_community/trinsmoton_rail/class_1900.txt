The Trinsmoton Rail Class 1900 is an Electric Multiple Unit designed and built by Misoba Motors.

===== History =====

In 1999, [[mtr_community:trinsmoton_rail:nctr|New Croydon Transit Railway (NCTR)]] ordered 7 Electric Multiple Units to be used for the upcoming Lorem Ipsum Line. The trains were supposedly 5 carriages long but due to maintenance cost being too high for that time it was decided that the new trains will be 4 carriages long instead. In 2000-2001 the trains were shipped from Japan to the Spawn International Port and were put in service in 2002.
