====== DLR B85 & B86 Stock ======

The **DLR B85 & B86 Stocks** are dual carriage Third Rail Electric Multiple Units running on the [[mtr_community:trinsmoton_rail:dlr|Devonsfield Light Railway]]. These units were the first trains to be used on the DLR and is built by Movin-cammel. Hence the different motor comparing to its little brother: The [[mtr_community:trinsmoton_rail:b92|B92 stock]].

===== History =====

In 1985 and 1986 two new light rail companies were formed: The **Jungle Island Circular Light Railway (JICLR)** and the **Drypsten and Spawn LRT (DSLRT)**. Both which needed a train to be used for the 2 railways. The trains were delivered on time in Mid-1986 to their respective railways and went into service in October that year. The trains on the JICLR are 2 carriages while the DSLRT variant was 4 carriages long by linking 2 B86 stocks together. In 1992 the B86 stock trains on the DSLRT was replaced by the brand new [[mtr_community:trinsmoton_rail:b92|B92 stock]] which has better acceleration speeds than the B86 stocks. In 2012, the B85 stocks on the Jungle Circle Line got a refurbishment. This includes a new motor, and 1 new carriage in between. The trains are painted in a lime green and dark green livery, representing Jungle Island's famous tall green trees.
