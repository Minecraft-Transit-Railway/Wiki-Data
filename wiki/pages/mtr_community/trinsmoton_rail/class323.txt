====== Trinsmoton Rail Class 323 ======

The **Trinsmoton Rail Class 323 ** is an electric multiple unit that operates on various routes. The first trains were ordered by [[mtr_community:trinsmoton_rail#Regional|Trinsmoton Rail]] for the usage on the Harroash Line as the /1 series. The trains were sent to [[mtr_community:trinsmoton_rail:northern|Northern Rail]] after the trains were replaced by [[mtr_community:trinsmoton_rail:class_250|Class 250 Commutras]] which have a higher acceleration speed. In 1994, the demand for more trains on the [[mtr_community:nnw|Network Northwest]] mainline routes is needed. Therefore the /0s are made which have a completely different motor comparing to its /1 counterpart. A few trains were also donated to [[mtr_community:trinsmoton_rail:northern|Northern Rail]] and some to [[mtr_community:trinsmoton_rail:vtr|VTR Crossrail]].
