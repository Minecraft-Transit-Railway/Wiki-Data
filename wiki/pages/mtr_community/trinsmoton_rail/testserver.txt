====== Trinsmoton Test Server ======

===== Start =====

Before the [[mtr_community:trinsmoton_rail:mainserver|Main Server]] came along Trinsmoton started as a little test server created by Officeragent100 on Aternos around September 2023. The first station created was Spawn((This version of Spawn has been demolished as it was nowhere close to the actual Spawnpoint and too close to Ocean Bay. It was replaced by Old Spawn DLR station instead.)), where there was an island platform, some weirdly placed lifts and a pair of escalators, both of which leads down to the old entrance located underground. The station was located around 500 blocks west away from the actual Spawnpoint. The first line was constructed with the help of X3N_Plays which will become the [[mtr_community:trinsmoton_rail:vtr#Croydon Railway|Croydon Rail]] Route 1. After ChaoDee0724 joined the server in 27th September 2023 he became 1 of the main people to contribute on the server. For example, upgrading the station roof of Spawn((This version of Spawn has been demolished as it was nowhere close to the actual Spawnpoint and too close to Ocean Bay. It was replaced by Old Spawn DLR station instead.)) and adding a main entrance for Ocean Bay.

===== NCTR =====

[[mtr_community:trinsmoton_rail:nctr|New Croydon Transit Railway]] was created by ChaoDee0724 after the completion of the Spawn's station roof upgrade and Lorem Ipsum Line opened on the same day with 2 stations: Pentium Hills and Ocean Bay. It was later extended to Drypstensvagtklippe((
Now South Drypstensvagtklippe.
)) and then Three Borders, in which Officeragent100 built the design. Cactusville-by-the-sea station opened alongside Turtlesgate, Lake Congelado and Sierra de Alpino. All stations were unfinished when opened.

===== The rollercoaster ride of Croydon Rail =====

Route 2 of [[mtr_community:trinsmoton_rail:vtr#Croydon Railway|Croydon Rail]] officially opened in 29th September 2023. Using a single track system. ChaoDee0724 originally connected the route with Jungle Island but Officeragent100 didn't like the idea, saying it'll jam the system.

[[mtr_community:trinsmoton_rail:vtr#Croydon Railway|Croydon Rail]] was supposedly to have a Route 3, which is also uses single track system. However the tracks looks very curvy and it was disused for the next few weeks.

===== The Docklands Light Railway =====

The first DLR line opened in 1st October 2023 by ChaoDee0724. Instead of opening stations one at a time, this time the route opened fully with 13 stations at the go, this line was called the Drypstensvagtklippe Line.

===== Northern takeover =====

In 11th October 2023, as a little "realism" Officeragent100 gives ChaoDee0724 the [[mtr_community:trinsmoton_rail:vtr#Croydon Railway|Croydon Rail]] Route 1, 2 and 3 to takeover. Originally ChaoDee0724 had already made some liveries for a server: [[mtr_community:trinsmoton_rail:chaodom|Chaodom]]. He decides to use the liveries for [[mtr_community:trinsmoton_rail:northern|Northern Rail]] and replace the ugly Class 377 [[mtr_community:trinsmoton_rail:vtr#Croydon Railway|Croydon Rail]] retextures with more simpler Blue and White livery. Routes 1 and 2 were converted to Northern Rail the next day. Route 3 was converted into a DLR Line at first known as the East Parade Shuttle. Afterwards it was converted into NCTR Buckington Line after a new track is built which is less bendy as the old one is.
