====== Northern Rail ======

**Northern Rail (NR)** is a rail company running mostly on the northern region of Trinsmoton.

===== History =====

Northern Rail was founded as part of Areeta in 2014 during the final days of Areeta operating. The first plans were to have a service between Newhaven and Riverside. but that never came along. Instead, at the same time [[mtr_community:trinsmoton_rail:vtr#Croydon Railway|VTR Rail (Known as Croydon Rail at the time)]] reached out and asked if Northern can operate their Spawn to Jungle Wood line during their refurbishment. The 2 companies agreed and Northern operated the route for approximately 3 months. Currently it operates the Spawn to Turnipsfield branch line and there are further plans to extend the line.
