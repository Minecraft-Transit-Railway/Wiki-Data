===== History =====

==== Lorem Ipsum Line ====

Lorem Ipsum Line opened in 1994, at that time using [[mtr_community:trinsmoton_rail:class_604|Class 604]] For the route. During the late 1990s Lorem Ipsum Line only has 9 stops, extending to Sierra de Alpino from Ocean Bay. In 2002 all the [[mtr_community:trinsmoton_rail:class_604|Class 604s]] running on the route were replaced by [[mtr_community:trinsmoton_rail:class_605|Class 605s]] which have a faster top speed. In 2004 the line extended to Spawn. In 2013 an extension project was planned called "The Southwestern Extension" which will add 23 more stops along the Lorem Ipsum Line. Currently 3 out of 23 stations were opened to public on the extension.

==== Buckington Line ====

Originally Buckington Line was a proposed project in 2013 by [[mtr_community:trinsmoton_rail:vtr|VTR]] called the "Branch Line 2". However the tracks were too bendy for the rolling stocks they had at the time and therefore the route was cancelled. In 2014 [[mtr_community:trinsmoton_rail:vtr|VTR]] handed the project to [[mtr_community:trinsmoton_rail:dlr|DLR]] which DLR reopened the stretch between East Parade and Spawn and the route was called "East Parade Shuttle". However Buckington was still disconnected as the tracks cannot fit the rolling stocks on the DLR aswell. In 2016 NCTR took charge of the project and rebuilt the tracks from East Parade to Buckington. The line was renamed to "Buckington Line" and replaced the DLR rolling stock with the [[mtr_community:trinsmoton_rail:class_524|Class 524]].
