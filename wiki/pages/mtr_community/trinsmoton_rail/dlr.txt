====== Devonsfield Light Railway ======

**Devonsfield Light Railway (DLR)** is a light rail system that covers the central Trinsmoton.

===== History =====

==== Jungle Circle Line ====

DLR started as a small budget railway around Jungle Island before the [[mtr_community:trinsmoton_rail:underground|Underground]] serves that area with Pentraolis Line in 1985. It was called the **Jungle Island Circular Light Railway**, as the line runs as a circle line. The line is now known as the Jungle Circle Line.

==== Drypstensvagtklippe Line & Pentium and Valley Line ====

In 1986, another light railway is being constructed. Known as the **Drypsten and Spawn LRT**. The line goes from South Drypstensvagtklippe, at that time only served by Areeta, to Spawn Railway Station, a giant rail hub. After the success of the line DSLR decided to make a smaller line that branches out from Pentium Hills East to Krille Valley, a small village located on an island nearby. The line got plenty of success and attracted the [[mtr_community:trinsmoton_rail:river|River Ferries]] to make a service from Ocean Bay to Krille Valley.

==== Vendover Line ====

In 1999 DSLR opened a new small line known as the **Vendover Shuttle**. The line goes from Vendover to Ashton, where it connects with the [[mtr_community:trinsmoton_rail:underground|Underground]]. Later Dischbury Park was opened in 2000 and is now called the **Vendover Line**.

==== Multi-biome Line ====

In 2003 the 2 railways: JICLR and DSLR merged to become the **United Light Railways**. ULR plans to have a line that goes to Three Borders via Devonsfield, a brand new station thatâ€™s proposed by [[mtr_community:trinsmoton_rail:zenrail|ZenRail]]. After the opening of Multi-biome ULR renames their brand to **Devonsfield Light Railway**.
