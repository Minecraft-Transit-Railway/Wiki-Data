===== Info =====

The [[mtr_community:centralia:warringtonflyer|Warrington Flyer]] isn't really an operator, but more a system of lines under no real ownership. The system is seen by many as arbitrary, with most of the line serving no real purpose apart from the branch to [[mtr_community:centralia:stations:warringtonpond|Warrington Pond]]. The lines lost their last bit of usefulness in the Centraliaverse when Bus Routes [[mtr_community:centralia:buses:route45|45]] and [[mtr_community:centralia:buses:route72|72]] were created, which stopped at Warrington Grove bus stop, located just 150 metres west of Warrington Pond station, which stands isolated in a forest.
The system is abandoned, but still operational. Due to its decreasing purpose, it is under threat of being completely demolished.
