====== Banks Heath ======

[[mtr_community:centralia:stations:banksheath|Banks Heath]] is the oldest operating train station in all of [[mtr_community:centralia|Centralia]], the stations design is unique and is based off the town houses opposite. It was originally opened by the Haruna & Sendai City Railway. It passed over to [[mtr_community:centralia:cr|Centralia Rail]] gaining a 3rd platform before again being passed over to the [[mtr_community:centralia:cmr|Centralia Metropolitan Railway]]. The station building design can also be found in other places throughout the city, but the building at this station is the original, being the first of its kind in the area. The station hasn't seen a lot of changes throughout the years, and has generally always looked the way it does today. Another sign of its classic status is the lack of step-free access, despite reasonable space for a lift bridge.
