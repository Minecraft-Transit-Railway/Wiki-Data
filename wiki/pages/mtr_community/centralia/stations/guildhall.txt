====== Guildhall ======

The station at the [[mtr_community:centralia:stations:guildhall|Guildhall]] is one of the older, but yet more unique-looking stations on the map. It is the first station the player encounters when they first launch the world, as the spawn is set to the [[mtr_community:centralia:stations:guildhall|Guildhall]] itself, with the station located just outside it. The station lives in the shadow of the Centralia [[mtr_community:centralia:stations:guildhall|Guildhall]] which was the main defense during the Dragon Era, today it's a museum. At first, the station was just a simple overpass with stairs down to two platforms, but the station was completely overhauled in v1.1.5, when the [[mtr_community:centralia:cmr:sendailine|Sendai Line]] was extended into new underground platforms and a bus loop was added.
The station building is very loosely based off Park Royal Station.
