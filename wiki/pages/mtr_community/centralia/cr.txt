===== Info =====

[[mtr_community:centralia:cr|Centralia Rail]] is a publicly owned rail company which serves the Central and Suburb areas of [[mtr_community:centralia|Centralia City]] and [[mtr_community:centralia:stations:hibiki|Hibiki]] Prefecture. It is focused on overground trains, but also owns the underground [[mtr_community:centralia:cr:centralandjunctionline|Central & Junction Line]] to connect the two main transport hubs of the Central area. It is the second oldest active operator in [[mtr_community:centralia|Centralia]], only being outdated by [[mtr_community:centralia:cmr|Centralia Metropolitan Rail]]. As a result of this age, a lot of its lines have changed services over the years, with some being extended, rerouted, or sometimes even shortened. After selling off the [[mtr_community:centralia:cr:maidsmoretonline|Maids Moreton Line]] to [[mtr_community:centralia:mrw|Moszyan Railways]], [[mtr_community:centralia:cr|Centralia Rail]] has mainly being focusing on extending its existing lines to regions outside of the Central and Suburb area.
