===== Info =====

The [[mtr_community:centralia:centrewest|Centrewest Light Railway]] (not to be confused with  Centrewest Buses), is a light rail operator in Western [[mtr_community:centralia|Centralia]] operated by Centralia Transport formed by the merger of RCC Tramways and Armour Island Light Railway. While most of the Armour Island Light Rail's route was preserved, now as the [[mtr_community:centralia:centrewest:blueroute|Centrewest Blue Route]], RCC Tramways had its system completely demolished and reworked from the ground up. The [[mtr_community:centralia:centrewest|The Centrewest Light Railway]] consists of four routes, which all meet at [[mtr_community:centralia:stations:hibiki|Hibiki]] station. The [[mtr_community:centralia:centrewest:greenroute|Green Route]], due to its path, runs two services, one between the depot at Gull Ruins to [[mtr_community:centralia:stations:headstone|Headstone]], and one between [[mtr_community:centralia:stations:headstone|Headstone]] and [[mtr_community:centralia:stations:rhosyngarddcentral|Rhosyngardd Central]].
