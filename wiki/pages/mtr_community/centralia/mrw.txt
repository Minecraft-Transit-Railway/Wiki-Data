===== Info =====

[[mtr_community:mrw|Moszyan Railways]] is the youngest operator in the city of [[mtr_community:centralia|Centralia]], being the only currently active one created in 2023. It was created after [[mtr_community:szandorthe13th|szandorthe13th]] took over the [[mtr_community:centralia:cr:maidsmoretonline|Maids Moreton Line]] from [[mtr_community:centralia:cr|Centralia Rail]] to extend it and turn it into a full line. This line would end up being the [[mtr_community:centralia:mrw:tridentline|Trident Line]]. Due to this identity, the operator originally had called itself "Trident Railways" as well. This can still be seen on the EOD release of [[mtr_community:centralia|Centralia]], where the [[mtr_community:centralia:mrw:tridentline|Trident Line]] is referred to with the prefix "TR". After construction of [[mtr_community:centralia:stations:mayrowecentral|Mayrowe Central]], with new signage for all of the previous stations on the line, it was officially renamed to [[mtr_community:mrw|Moszyan Railways]]. [[mtr_community:mrw|Moszyan Railways]] also co-owns the section of the [[mtr_community:centralia:cmr:eulaline|Eula Line]] between [[mtr_community:centralia:stations:garbeck|Garbeck]] and [[mtr_community:centralia:stations:anemonebay|Anemone Bay]], as the extension of the line moved the sidings over to the TMT Complex, which happens to be [[mtr_community:mrw|Moszyan Railways]]' headquarters.
