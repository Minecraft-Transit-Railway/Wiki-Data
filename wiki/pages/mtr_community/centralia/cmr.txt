===== Info =====

[[mtr_community:centralia:cmr|Centralia Metropolitan Railway Company]] is wholly owned subsidiary of Centralia Transport, a Transit Authority which runs services within [[mtr_community:centralia|Centralia City]] and [[mtr_community:centralia:stations:hibiki|Hibiki]] Prefecture including, Metro trains, Light Metro trains, Light Rail trains and Buses. It is the oldest operator in the area, essentially stemming from the former Haruna & Sendai City Railway, of which you can still see the typical station buildings along the [[mtr_community:centralia:cmr:lakesideline|Lakeside Line]]. Some of its lines are still incomplete, and there are a lot of remnants of old lines left over to this day. Recently, [[mtr_community:centralia:cmr|Centralia Metropolitan Railway Company]] collaborated with [[mtr_community:centralia:mrw|Moszyan Railways]] to have the [[mtr_community:centralia:cmr:eulaline|Eula Line]] extended out of the city as it was originally planned to do.
