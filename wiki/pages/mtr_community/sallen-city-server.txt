====== Introduction ======

The City of Sallen is an American-based city server which had recently expanded to include metro from all over the world. The server has many reputable areas along with new and growing developments.

==== History ====

The Sallen City you know today originally started out as a Roblox server, by the name of [[https://www.roblox.com/groups/9122249/Victoria-County-Transportation-Authority#!/about|Victoria Country Transit (VCT)]]. VCT was primarily developed by agentdevv (@BlazaTheMan), f29/LTDelTaco (@AbandonedCrew), BostonianBoy (@Sir_MMK) [SIDENOTE: WILL ADD HYPERLINKS TO PROFILE LATER], and others now moving on to other projects. It created ROBLOX((
%%Roblox is %%a global platform where millions of people gather together every day to imagine, create, and share experiences with each other in immersive, user-generated 3D worlds%%. The types of gameplay on Roblox are just as limitless as the imagination of the creators themselves. (source: %%[[https://corporate.roblox.com/parents/#:~:text=What%20is%20Roblox%3F,imagination%20of%20the%20creators%20themselves|What is ROBLOX?]])
)) Bus & Train games loosely based off the MTA Subway [NEEDS HYPERLINK].

Sallen City was originally a private, vanilla server. The map itself was a superflat, with many areas of the city being filled with villages. Liberty Plaza, Fort Yasuko, and Lakeshore all originated from this version of Sallen, commonly referred to as "Old Sallen."

Old Sallen was created on April 14, 2022. It was owned by agentdevv (@agentdevv on discord), and was a server where only agentdevv, BostonianBoy (also known as SirMMK) and LTdelTaco (also known as f29) played.

Old Sallen is a beloved version of Sallen City and is used to show the difference between the current server and the original server. Old Sallen was converted to use MTR, but unfortunately, Aternos' corrupted the file and nothing saved (aternos moment jajaja). On May 31st 2023, this led to the creation of current Sallen City, a version called "Country of Sallen" which has since been reverted to Sallen City.

Modern-day Sallen City is a large step forward from Old Sallen. The MTR mod was the focal point of the server, allowing systems to become more complex than their Old Sallen counterpart.

=== Old Sallen Railways ===

Old Sallen had three different transportation systems, even before MTR. The original three goes as followed:

- Sallen City Transit (SCT) by [[mtr_community:agentdevv|agentdevv]]

- Sallen Metro Transportation (SMT) by [[mtr_community:starjunction|starjunction/LTDelTaco]]

- Sallen City Regional Transportation Authority (SCRTA) by [[mtr_community:Sir_MMK|Sir_MMK]]

===== Sallen City Transit =====

==== Introduction ====

Sallen City Transit, or SCT, is the largest and most notable rail company in Sallen City, owned by [[mtr_community:agentdevv|agentdevv]] and [[mtr_community:apache|apache]]. Sallen City Transit is heavily inspired and based off the MTA Subway<sup>1</sup> While most IRT and IND lines are developed by [[mtr_community:agentdevv|agentdevv]], [[mtr_community:apache|apache]] develops the BMT lines.

==== History ====

In Old Sallen, Sallen City Transit was arguably the best way to get around Sallen City. Stopping in densely populated areas of Sallen, it was a very reliable system. Every station had a unique design and feel, as well as the lines being organized and simple to navigate.

When modern-day Sallen was created (5/31/23), two now-abandoned stations were created to serve a proposed line: North Beach and Breen K. Sallen Road.

SCT was the first system created on the modern-day Sallen server, with the Hamilton Blvd Lines (A)(C) being the first lines on the server [Fort Yasuko <-> Edgeword]. Now, SCT is expanding faster than ever, with many new lines being created to provide Sallen with fast and reliable service.

Modern-day Sallen City Transit is arguably the most reliable way to get across Sallen City. Whether you're coming from Westfield Airport (spawn) or all the way from Planktonville, SCT is considered one of the fastest systems in Sallen.

==== What's next? ====

Sallen City Transit is getting closer and closer to completion, with the newest addition of the Crosstown Lines (7) <7>! It's the fastest growing company on the server, and it won't stop! Watch out, SCT could be coming to your local neighborhood.

===== SMART Transit =====

%%SMART Transit was one of the first rail companies in the modern City of Sallen. The company was founded on May 30th of 2023 by Sir_MMK. SMART Transit hosts the Sallen Ferry, SallenRail Transportation and the SMART LRT. The first section of the LRT opened in June 2023, between Newton Docks and Newton-City Terminal. Further extensions would open in the following months. The LRT extensions prior to the Grand Shutdown ran parallel to SCT and ApacheRail (now shutdown). %%

On July 7th, 2023, the LRT Great Northern line would open, making 19 stops between Bloomington Village and Westfield Airport (previously Northwest Klein Airport). The (B) and the now closed (D) lines served the Great Northern Local, while the (A) served Great Northern Express, bypassing most stations as a skip-stop service.

After careful consideration by Sir_MMK, the (D) line was later closed, as it did not serve an additional purpose to the (E) and caused overcongestion on the Great Northern.

%%In July 2023, SMART made a project to rebuild Newton Terminal. This project would lead to the Grand Shutdown in September of the 2023. The Grand Shutdown for the LRT was from September of 2023 to December of 2023. The LRT would be closed in its entirety for heavy improvements. More realisitic tunnel walls, extended platforms, improved stations, and catenary systems were all added during the four month shutdown. %%

In August 2023, SMART Transit and Sallen City Transit collaborated to start constructing new lines: the SMART (C) making local stops, and the SCT (L) making express stops to Stelham Haven. After other projects were prioritized however, these lines' development were halted and have yet to receive attention again.

%%SMART Ferry would open in Late Summer of 2023 between Old Village Pier and Newton Docks. The Old Village Ferry was extended in August of 2023. This would bring it to the small village of Devinstown served by SMT. The Old Village Ferry was renamed to the F1 with this change. The F2 would open due to the Grand Shutdown on the LRT. This route runs between Newton Docks and Little Village Pier.%%

===== SallenRail =====

Sallen Commuter Rail, or SallenRail for short is a railroad company owned by SMART Transit. It was originally owned by SCT as "AirRed", but due to lack of funding & motivation by [[mtr_community:agentdevv|agentdevv]], it was sold to FT (Fries Technology).

%%SallenRail Transportation was first a concept for many months. The first proposals for SallenRail were drafted in Late July of 2023. Initially, this was a collaboration project between SMART and the now shutdown ApacheRail (SRTC), with Broadview station being constructed in Early August by ApacheRail. It was proposed that SMART would maintain SallenRail north of Newton Terminal, and ApacheRail would maintain SallenRail south of Broadview Station. %%

%%Later on, Newton Terminal would be built and progress quickly began with the Mainline having its first section open in September of 2023. M7/A and M8 models were supplied to SallenRail by Fries Technology (FT). %%

%%In the same month, SallenRail opened the East End Line. The East End Line is a joint line operated by both SMART Transit and Lilypad Rail. With the East End Line and the Mainline rejoining at Great Plains which brings a direct link to Newton Terminal. The Birchwood Line is expected to open in January of 2024 bringing a unique change to how SMART handles its extensions with multiple branches spreading out at Birchwood Junction.%%

===== Lilypad Rail (Sallen) =====

//Not to be confused with [[https://wiki.minecrafttransitrailway.com/mtr_letsplay:lilypad_rail|Lilypad Rail (LPS)]] //

Lilypad Rail's Sallen Division opened on 5 September 2023, just under a year after the founding Let's Play division opened. It consists of 2 lines

  * Line 1 runs from Worth Street to Liberty Plaza via Myrtle Kennedy, Merrell, and Newton
  * Line 2 runs from Myrtle Kennedy to Diamond Creek via Lancet.

Currently, Lilypad Rail also operates the SallenRail East End Line, which runs from Old Westfield Terminal, then east through the median of the Westfield Highway before dipping underground, running through Edgeword South and East Holyoke before merging with existing SallenRail tracks north of Great Plains. Services operate through SallenRail tracks as far as Newton Terminal, and is planned to extend to Sallen International Airport.

The full Lilypad Rail buildout will see four lines and a light rail network. Line 1 will extend west from Worth Street to Orchard Park via Langstone. Line 2 will continue extending north until reaching Line 3 north of the Westfield Highway. Line 3 will start at Woodhaven, running north of the Westfield Highway until reaching Line 2, it will then dip south below the highway to interchange with the Violet Line and Bayside Line at a station south of the airport. It will continue again to meet the Bayside Line at Anemone station, before turning south through Jade Grove and Langstone until meeting the SCT Moscato lines at Yorktown. Line 4 will run east from Jade Grove, through Palisades and Holyoke, before turning south to meet SCT Calgary lines at Park Slope. Line 4B will operate as a stub of Line 4, running from Holyoke to meet the PR East Sallen Line at Creighton. The Orchard Park Light Rail will radiate from the Line 1 station at Orchard Park. The plan includes branches to meet Line 2 at multiple points, and to meet SMT 7 at Freeport.

===== Sallen Metro Transit =====

Sallen Metro Transit, or SMT was one of the four original companies in new Sallen (SCT, SMART, SMT, ApacheRail), mainly operating services in Clinton. It was created and now owned by [[starjunction]], also one of the three builders in Old Sallen.

Initially, lines were given two different names based off the direction they were going in, similar to how [[wp>Grand_Theft_Auto_IV|GTA IV]]'s metro system worked. The (1) was named the 1/2, the (2) was named the 3/4, the (3) was named the 5/6, and so on and so forth.

In July 2023, the SMT 5/6 (now the 3) lines were constructed from Liberty Plaza to Wabash, stopping at Devinstown, Barnesville, Riverton Village, Great Plains, Holyoke, Edgeword, and Wabash. This was the only SMT line (before the merge) to go north of and not primarily serve Clinton.

In August 2023, the SMT 11/12 (now the 6) was finished, codenamed the "Great Plains Loop". This line served now-major transit hubs such as Great Plains, Myrtle-Kennedy, Maple Park, and the Nexus Promenade.
