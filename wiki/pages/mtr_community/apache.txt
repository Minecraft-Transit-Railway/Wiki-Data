Hey! I'm Apache, one of the newer members of the MTR Community. You can find me most often in the #americas channel, posting some of my NYC based builds. I currently build in  and United Cities Railways. I currently live in Manhattan, NYC (which is why I build a lot of nyc shit).

I bought Minecraft solely because of this mod (yeah fr) around Mid-Late June, but I mostly built singleplayer at the time, with my absolutely diabolical stations ("apache central" is a great example of that). Soon after, agentdevv (MrDevster at the time) let me join Sallen, in which I created ApacheRail. At the time, Sallen was a closed off server with just me and a few others (agentdevv, starjunction, BostononianBoy), and it was just shits and giggles lmao.

As you can tell from my profile picture in Discord, I've been a big fan of Nichijou (i'm not a weeb i swear) for a while now, and my favorite characters are Mai and Sakamoto! If you have some time, feel free to strike up a conversation with me, I'd love to chat! That's about it from me, so yeah.
