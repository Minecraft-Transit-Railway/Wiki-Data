**Cin Gyun Line** was created by Ludwig (by his discord or LudwigTails by Youtube). The line was first proposed and opened on (forgot date).

The line opened in phases, so far 5 phases have been confirmed with one more coming soon. With each phase having 3 stations.

The line in phase 1 consisting and starting from [[mtr_letsplay:lake_city_station|Lake City]], following stations are Snowberry Hill, Winter City. Phase 2 consist of Inage Kaigan, Ash Shore and Paddy Valley. Phase 3 consists of Dragon's Bay, Alto Mare and Luk Kau Tong. Phase 4 (which is currently still being work in progress) Consist of Lavender Edge along with 2 other unnamed stations which are Station 11 and Station 12. Station 11 is inspired by Choi Hong Station from Kwun Tong Line in real life. For Station 12 and future Phase 5's station 13 and 14 are inspired from  the real life section of Kwun Tong Line's Kowloon Bay to Kwun Tong.

The line first operated with 4 car trains with the fleet consisting of K-Train (being the main fleet), C-Train, M-Train and Q-Train (retextured C-Train). However the official opening of the line's Phase 3 section was opened on the 1/10/2023. The first extended 8 car train had entered service on the line allowing for more capacity to be handled on the line. And every day since then 2 4 car trains are extended/swapped out to 8 cars, sometimes 4 depending on how Ludwig was feeling during the day of the swap. on 25/10/2023, it was confirmed that the last 4 car train will retire on the 29/10/2023.
