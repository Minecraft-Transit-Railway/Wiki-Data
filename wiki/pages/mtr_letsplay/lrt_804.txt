===== History =====

On 20 October 2023, [[qingli_railways|Qingli Railways]] released the "Lilac Light Rail Reform Plan 2023", and Route 804 is included in this plan, running between Kallos and Light Rail Depot, which forms a circulating route similar to [[lrt_505|route 505]].

On 25 October 2023, Route 804 is decided to extend to Taipa via 3 new stations, Mou Lun, Casper Lake and Pai Kok, and 2 existing stations, Royal Park and Humugath.

On 1 November 2023, Kallos stop is removed from routes [[lrt_801|801]], [[lrt_802|802]] and [[lrt_802|802S]] in order to prepare for the opening of route 804.

On 2 November 2023, the connection between Humugath and Royal Park, and the new connection from Light Rail Depot to Kallos, and to Royal Park is completed. Route 804 is then fully operational.

On 3 November 2023, Hong Sing Mountain Base station was retrofitted to allow connection to the Hong Sing Mountain Village Cable Car for access to the village atop the mountain, at whose base the LRT sits.
