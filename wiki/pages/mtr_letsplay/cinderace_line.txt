The Cinderace Line ([[wp>Chinese_language|Chinese]]: 閃焰王牌綫) is a core part of the [[ShimanoMTR|ShimanoMTR]] network and runs in a figure 6 through the northwestern area of Spawn and through [[Llanmara]].

===== History =====
Planning for this line began in August 2022, and a sign announcing its existence was installed at Extreme Hot Springs Station.

A Cinderace Line reservation platform was also installed at Shirokaba Mansion Station, which was completed in September 2022.

Construction began at Azalea Station in September 2022, and Line S11T opened between Azalea Station and Extreme Hot Springs Station in October 2022.

In November 2022, Line S11 will open between Kurokusa Mansion Station and Shirokaba Mansion Station.

Line S11T opened in early December 2022 between Extreme Hot Spring Station and Ying Chuk Station, and between Ying Chuk Station and Cinderace Station.

It will open between Azalea Station and Kurokaba Mansion Station in early January 2023. Line S11T has been merged into Line S11 and has been discontinued.

At the same time, a permanent depot was constructed approximately 1.5 km east of Ying chuk station.

It was extended from Ying Chuk station to Black Lea station in March 2023.

Queen Elizabeth II Station opens in July 2023.

In early August 2023, the entire loop line section opened from Shirokaba Mansion Station to Cinderace Station.

The final section, between Black Lea and Llanmara stations, will open in late August 2023. All sections are now open except for Twynn Station along the way.

From the end of 2023, due to server lag due to an increase in the number of players, a stuck area occurred near the Depot, so the service frequency was temporarily reduced to 6 minutes from December 30, 2023. 
April 4, 2024. By moving the Depot to the south and changing the alignment to make it difficult for passengers to get stuck, the service frequency was returned to 2 and a half minutes. The site of the old Depot will be used as the [[Jigglypuff Line]] Depot.

===== Rolling Stocks =====
See [[mtr_letsplay:11-000_series|Terralith Rapid Transit 11-000 Series]].
===== Operations =====

All trains operate in 9-car formations. All trains run clockwise from Ying Chuk, return to Ying Chuk, and continue towards Llanmara.

As mentioned above, it used to be 6 minutes, but after relocating the Depot, it has been returned to 2 and a half minutes.
