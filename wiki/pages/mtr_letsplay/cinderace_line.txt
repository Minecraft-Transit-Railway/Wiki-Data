Construction began at Azalea Station in September 2022, and Line S11T opened between Azalea Station and Extreme Hot Springs Station in October 2022.

In November 2022, Line S11 will open between Kurokusa Mansion Station and Shirokaba Mansion Station.

Line S11T opened in early December 2022 between Extreme Hot Spring Station and Ying Chuk Station, and between Ying Chuk Station and Cinderace Station.

It will open between Azalea Station and Kurokaba Mansion Station in early January 2023. Line S11T has been merged into Line S11 and has been discontinued.
