CrossCountry, commonly abbreviated to XC, is a long-distance and regional intercity train operator on the Let's Play Server. It is a joint venture between ElectrostarJudge, who operates the North Western Region, and Soodari, who operates the South Western Region services. In future, it is hoped both regions can be linked to provide a through service from Portsmouth and the South West to destinations such as Teufort Central, Einsburg Central, Ilford Island/Kirkenkessie Gateway, and Marylebone alongside other locations.

==== Fleet ====

On long distance services, CrossCountry primarily operate a fleet of Diesel Hitachi Class 802 units, as well as a small fleet of loco-hauled Class 67 & Mark X Carriages in Sleeper and Day formations. For Regional services, CrossCountry utilise a fleet of 2-3 car Class 170 DMUs, which can be used in sets of up to 6 Carriages.
