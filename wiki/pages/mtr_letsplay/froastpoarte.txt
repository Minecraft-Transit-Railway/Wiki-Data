====== Froastpoarte Station ======
**Froastpoarte** is a bi-level overground station with 4 platforms, serving Lilac Light Rail lines 633 and 633P, as well as Moszyan Railways' overground service system. It was rebuilt to look like **Lansingerland-Zoetermeer** station, but with the light and heavy rail platforms swapped. Prior to its reconstruction, it was a generic Lilac Light Rail station by the name of **Shuangmen Xuegui**.
