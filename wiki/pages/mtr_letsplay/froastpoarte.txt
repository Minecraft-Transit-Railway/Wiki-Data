====== Froastpoarte Station ======
**Froastpoarte** is a bi-level overground station with 4 platforms, serving Lilac Light Rail lines 633 and 633P, as well as Moszyan Railways' overground service system. It was rebuilt to look like **Lansingerland-Zoetermeer** station, but with the light and heavy rail platforms swapped. Prior to its reconstruction, it was a generic Lilac Light Rail station by the name of **Shuangmen Xuegui** using the "Taipa & South Corridor" station design.

===== Layout =====
The station has 4 platforms, two north-south through tracks for the Lilac Light Rail on the lower level, and two eastbound terminus platforms for Moszyan Railways on the upper level. Unlike the rest of the [[mtr_letsplay:fryskeline|Fryske Line]], these upper platforms have grass for a ballast, referencing the real life station's upper platforms originally being light rail platforms.

The relatively short length of the platforms also makes it impossible for longer //Intercity// trains to access the station, limiting service to mostly //Sprinter// trains.

===== Trivia =====
  * Despite the rename to **Froastpoarte**, the original Chinese name **Shuangmen Xuegui** remains the CJK notation for the station.
  * The name **Shuangmen Xuegui** is a pun on having the same pronunciation as the term for a double-door refridgerator, and the name **Froastpoarte** was chosen to retain at least the spirit of the pun, translating the first two characters to Frisian.
  * This station was the first station on the server to have both Dutch //and// Japanese stop markers installed on the platforms.
