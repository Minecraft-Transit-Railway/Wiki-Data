=====History=====
On 9 April 2023, apart from [[lrt_717_8|routes 717 and 718]], [[lilypad_rail]] proposed another 2 circular routes which has a smaller circle than the former routes, namely the "Tempest South Circular". The smaller circle is included in the Southwest of the big circle, taking up about one quarter of the area of it.

On 9 July 2023, routes 721 and 722 were completed together with the whole Tempest light rail network
