====== Modpack ======

To join our server you need to install some associated mods. They are distributed as a **modpack**. Once installed, the modpack automatically updates itself whenever we upgrade mods on the server, there's no need to manually update mods.

===== Supported Launchers =====

The launchers that are capable of installing the modpack includes **PrismLauncher, MultiMC, ATLauncher **and **Hello Minecraft! Launcher**.

Setting up modpacks isn't quite as straight-forward on the official Mojang launcher or some other launchers, in which case I'd recommend using a launcher in that list, such as PrismLauncher. It's sorta easy to get used to and it's free and open-source. You can **[[https://prismlauncher.org/download/|get PrismLauncher here]]**.

===== Tutorial for Installing =====

==== The Link ====

The following instructions will involve copying and pasting a link into your launcher. You can copy that link here:

<code ->

</code>

(Use this link instead should you live in mainland China: ''%%https://www.mcmtr.top/LetsPlay-Packwiz/MTR-LetsPlay.zip%%'' )

===== Additional Mods =====

The pack already contains some quality-of-life mods, such as Sodium, Iris, and WorldEdit CUI. If you want to install additional mods, simply drop them into the mods folder. The updater knows which files are added by you and won't delete them.

Some mods you might be interested in:

  * Distant Horizons
  * ... or, Bobby
  * Xaero's Minimap & Xaero's World Map
  * Fabric-Carpet (for CreativeNoClip)
  * MiniHud (& Malilib as dependency)

===== Moving your previous stuff over =====

In case you've been previously playing and want to keep your Map, Distant Horizons data etc., simply move the associated folders inside ''%%.minecraft%%'' over. These might include ''%%Distant_Horizons_server_data%%'', ''%%XaeroWorldMap%%'', ''%%XaeroWaypoints%%'', etc.

===== I'm a builder and want to hide WorldEdit CUI =====

Having the selection always showing up is pretty annoying indeed, but WorldEdit CUI allows you to bind a hotkey for the deselection action. Just assign it in control settings, press that key when you're done with WorldEdit stuff and the selection will be gone.
