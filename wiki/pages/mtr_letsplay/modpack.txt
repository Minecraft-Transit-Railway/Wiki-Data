====== Modpack ======

To join our server you need to install some associated mods. They are distributed as a **modpack**. Once installed, the modpack automatically updates itself whenever we upgrade mods on the server.

===== Supported Launchers =====

The launchers that are capable of installing the modpack includes **PrismLauncher, MultiMC, ATLauncher **and **Hello Minecraft! Launcher**.

If you are using the official launcher or one of the other launchers, I'd personally recommend trying out PrismLauncher. Although the first impression may be a bit visually unappealing, its rich functionalities and clutter-free experience really makes it a compelling choice. It's also free and open-source. You can **[[https://prismlauncher.org/download/|get PrismLauncher here]]**.

===== Tutorial for Installing =====

==== The Link ====

The following instructions will involve copying and pasting a link into your launcher. You can copy that link here:
