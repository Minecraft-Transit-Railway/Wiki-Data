====== Modpack ======

To join our server you need to install some associated mods. They are distributed as a **modpack**. Once installed, the modpack automatically updates itself whenever we upgrade mods on the server, there's no need to manually update mods.

===== Tutorial for Installing =====

<tabbox PrismLauncher/MultiMC> 

The following instructions will involve copying and pasting a link into your launcher. You can copy that link here:

<code ->

<tabbox Minecraft Launcher>

Setting it up on the official Mojang launcher is a bit more complicated. I'd recommend using one of the other launchers, such as PrismLauncher. It's sorta easy to get used to, and it's free and open-source. You can **[[https://prismlauncher.org/download/|get PrismLauncher here]]**.

  * Download the [[https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/|Fabric Installer]] and install Fabric Loader for Minecraft 1.19.2.
  * Start the Minecraft Installer, go to "Minecraft: Java Edition", and select the "Installations" page.
  * Find the "fabric-loader-1.19.2" installation. If you needs to change its "Game Directory", change it now.

  * Click on the folder button to open its game directory. Download [[https://minecraft-transit-railway.github.io/LetsPlay-Packwiz/packwiz-installer.zip|This ZIP archive containing JARs for Packwiz-Installer]], and extract the JARs into this game directory. They need to be in this directory, don't extract them into a sub-directory.
  * Click the three-dots button besides the "fabric-loader-1.19.2" installation, select edit, and select "more options".
  * Prepend the following text to "JVM arguments": \\ (Leave a space between the end of "toml" and the rest of the existing texts! Like: ...toml -Xmx, Not like: ...toml-Xmx)
<code ->
-javaagent:packwiz-installer-bootstrap-wrapper.jar=https://minecraft-transit-railway.github.io/LetsPlay-Packwiz/pack.toml
</code>
  * If you see "-Xmx2G" in JVM arguments, you might want to change it to a larger value, like "-Xmx4G" or "-Xmx8G". It's not the larger the better, you should consider how much RAM your PC has and leave a few GiBs of memory to spare. but if you have a powerful PC with like 16GB of memory, setting it to 8G would be better.



<tabbox Others>

I'd recommend using one of the other launchers, such as PrismLauncher. It's sorta easy to get used to, and it's free and open-source. You can **[[https://prismlauncher.org/download/|get PrismLauncher here]]**.

Also, you must own a geniune Minecraft account purchased from Mojang in order to join our server. Offline ("cracked") login is not supported and won't work.

===== Additional Mods =====

The pack only contains the basic stuff needed to join our server, leaving you more space for customizing your experience. To install additional mods, simply drop them into the mods folder. The updater knows which files are added by you and won't delete them.

The pack already contains optimization mods including Sodium and Iris. \\
You might be interested in adding some quality-of-life mods for a smoother experience. As a tip, here are a few mods that might be useful, you can choose as per your preference.

===== Moving your previous stuff over =====

In case you've been previously playing and want to keep your Map, Distant Horizons data etc., simply move the associated folders inside ''%%.minecraft%%'' over. These might include ''%%Distant_Horizons_server_data%%'', ''%%XaeroWorldMap%%'', ''%%XaeroWaypoints%%'', etc.
