====== Modpack ======

To join our server you need to install some associated mods. They are distributed as a **modpack**. Once installed, the modpack automatically updates itself whenever we upgrade mods on the server.

===== Supported Launchers =====

The launchers that are capable of installing the modpack includes **PrismLauncher, MultiMC, ATLauncher **and **Hello Minecraft! Launcher**.

If you are using the official launcher or one of the other launchers, I'd personally recommend trying out PrismLauncher. Although the first impression may be a bit visually unappealing, its rich functionalities and clutter-free experience really makes it a compelling choice. It's also free and open-source. You can **[[https://prismlauncher.org/download/|get PrismLauncher here]]**.

===== Tutorial for Installing =====

==== The Link ====

The following instructions will involve copying and pasting a link into your launcher. You can copy that link here:

===== Additional Mods =====

The pack already contains some quality-of-life mods, such as Sodium, Iris, and WorldEdit CUI. If you want to install additional mods, simply drop them into the mods folder. The updater knows which files are added by you and won't delete them.
