The **Terralith Rapid Transit 11-000 series** is an electric multiple unit (EMU) train type operated by the [[ShimanoMTR]](SMTR) on the [[Cinderace Line]].

=====Overview=====
Has the nickname "LIMACE-PT".
When constructing the Cinderace Line, there were sharp curves and slopes that could not be handled by ordinary full-size trains, so it was necessary to develop a dedicated small train.

Therefore, the 11-000 Series was manufactured based on a small subway using a linear motor introduced in Japan.

This train will be the first linear motor-driven train on the Let's Play server, and will be SMTR's first GoA4 fully unmanned subway car.

The vehicle design is based on Cinderace, and the front and sides are reminiscent of Cinderace.
There are 3 doors on the side and 2 split windows between the doors that can be opened and closed, and there is also a small window at the end of the car. The destination display uses full-color LEDs to improve visibility, but due to its structure, it is installed only at the front.
The interior of the car also has a design reminiscent of Cinderace. There are three seats at the front, six seats between the doors, and two seats at the end of the car. The material of the seat is non-combustible plastic and hard.
Straps are installed only between doors.
The lighting uses warm color LED lighting except for some trains.

Since it is assumed to be unmanned operation, there is no driver's cab, only a simple partition and a driver's cab.

In unmanned operation, the front seat can be used and the front view can be enjoyed, but the cab is covered and cannot be opened.

=====Difference in specifications=====
====Prototype (Shiny)====
{{ :mtr_letsplay:2023-04-02_14.38.52.png?300|}}
The main difference between the prototype and the mass-produced model is the coloring, which is based on Cinderace's Shiny motif.

The CInderace Line has the longest round-trip time on the SMTR and is the most difficult to come across as there is only one set of prototypes.

Only this vehicle is manufactured by Kawasaki Railcar.
====11-000====
{{ :mtr_letsplay:2022-12-19_19.06.23.png?300|}}
First manufactured group. VVVF sounds like a Toei 12-000 or MBTA 1800s.

　

　

　

====11-100====
{{ :mtr_letsplay:2023-02-05_05.51.44.png?300|}}
A train that was once used by the BTA, and was transferred from surplus vehicles when transferred to the Lime Line.

Raboot is the motif, but it leaves a strong impression of the BTA affiliation era.

The interior of the car has not changed much since the BTA era, and the 11-000 group uses white LED lighting, which is rare.

Since the transfer source is 11-000 base, the electrical equipment is the same as 11-000.

====11-200====
{{ :mtr_letsplay:2023-05-24_21.54.57.png?300|}}
Additional equipment due to extension work.

The design of the vehicle has become closer to Cinderace, and the side panels have been changed.

VVVF sounds like Namboku Line 9000 series and Skytrain Mark2.

It is said to be suitable for manned operation training, and in rare cases manned operation may be performed.


====11-300====
{{ :mtr_letsplay:2023-05-24_21.51.34.png?300|}}

Additional equipment due to extension work.

This vehicle is based on the Scorbunny motif and has a simple design compared to other vehicles.

In addition, the window of the door is large, making it easy to see the scenery below.

VVVF emits a characteristic screeching sound.

====11-500====
Additional equipment due to extension work.

Only this vehicle is nicknamed "LIMACE-UB".

Only this group is based on [[wp>BVG_Class_H|BVG Class H]].

====Replacement with the introduction of the 11-600====
//see [[Terralith Rapid Transit 11-600 Series]]//

Due to the large-scale renovation of the Delphox Line (which included a change in the line name from Cinderace Line to Delphox Line), the existing rolling stock would no longer be usable due to incompatible equipment, and so the introduction of new rolling stock was planned.

The renovation began on December 22, 2025, with the line name being changed to Delphox Line. However, since development of the rolling stock was not yet complete, the 11-000 and 11-500 cars temporarily retained their Cinderace livery, but the logo was changed to Delphox.

Development then progressed in late January of the following year, and the new cars will be introduced within at least a few weeks of this.

After the renovation, the existing rolling stock will no longer be able to run through narrow tunnels, so all 11-000 and 11-500 cars will be retired once the introduction is complete.

Some of the retired cars will be preserved.
