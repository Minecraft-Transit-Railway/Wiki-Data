====History====
On 9 January 2023, the transit connection between Makki Memorial Village and South Memorial has been decided to be a part of [[lilac_light_rail]] system, and the route number is decided to be 505.

This is the only route in the [[lilac_light_rail]] system to use light rail vehicles with double-sided doors, as in South Memorial stop, it opens both doors to connect to both South Continental Line platforms. 

Trains in route 505 circulate between Makki Memorial Village and South Memorial stop, forming a circular line. However, it is not counted as a circular route as only 2 stations are involved.

Route 505 is isolated from other light rail routes such that it has no light rail interchanges.((except for special route 578E)) However, according to "Lilac Light Rail Reform Plan 2023", a new route 803 will terminate at South Memorial stop, and that connected route 505 to the rest of the [[lilac_light_rail]] system.

Also, in the reform plan, this route and [[lrt_101_2|route 102]] are the only routes that do not require a frequency change.
