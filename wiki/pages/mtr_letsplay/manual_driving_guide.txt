====== Let's Play Server Manual Driving Guide ======

As a part of the [[mtr:4.0.x|MTR 4.0 update]], the manual driving system was [[https://youtu.be/xYEbU6G7jzo|significantly overhauled]]. When the Let's Play upgraded to MTR4, builders were able to utilise the new features to enhance the visitor experience on their lines and services. The Let's Play now has a number of lines that are able to be manually driven by visitors. Below is a list of lines and services that are able to be manually driven. The list will be updated as lines are added.

<sup>The original version of the manual driving guide was compiled by JamesQQ</sup>

The <color white/#090909>**Manual Driving Leaner's Line**</color> is rated 1/5 on the driving difficulty scale.
