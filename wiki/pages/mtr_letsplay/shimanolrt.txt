Shimano LRT (zh:縞野軽鐵) is an LRT line owned by [[Terralith Rapid Transit|Terralith Rapid Transit]] (TRT) and operated by [[ShimanoMTR|Shimano LRT]] (the LRT division of SMTR). It has a role to complement the railroad blank area of the route such as SMTR.

This system is based on the old TeufortLRT (TLRT) and has been customized for left-hand traffic. The vehicles were originally S43-Tec LRVs used in the TeufortLRT (TLRT), with the transition to MTR4, LIGHTACE has been upgraded to accommodate MTR4, and S43-Tec LRT has been replaced by S43-Tec Stadtbahn. A new vehicle called STADTACE has also been introduced.

=====Features=====
  * This line basically plays a complementary role to existing or planned lines with long distances between stations, including lines other than SMTR, so there is a strong tendency to construct it in parallel with the line. ((There are some routes that do not have parallel routes, such as the HG system.))
  * Except for existing stations, there is a strong tendency for station names to be written in Japanese.
  * Unlike SMTR, the construction method is simplified and tends not to create stations with different designs from station to station.
  * As mentioned above, it is compatible with the TLRT and actually once offered direct service to it.
  * In principle, only CJK ((example:"相01")) is indicated as the number, which is different from other LRT lines. ((English notation can be confirmed on the system map.))((The system numbers of the Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation are used as a reference.))
=====History=====
Plans for the first SLRT route were announced on August 21, 2024, and the first section of KR01 opened on August 26 of the same year to commemorate the opening of Utsunomiya LRT.

Through service with Teifot LRT U2 will begin on 13 February 2024.

All routes except for AL02 will be suspended on August 19, 2024. Through services of Teufort LRT and SMTR will also be suspended. In addition, all vehicles in service at the time, except for LRT 1928, will be taken out of service.

The next day, on August 20, the HG route temporarily resumed service with buses. Other routes were gradually resumed with the introduction of compatible LIGHTACE vehicles, and after through service with SMTR resumed on August 29, all SLRT services were restored. In connection with this, Landfall Station was renamed Kamiyonai Station. Management of the area around the station was transferred from Teufort LRT to TRT.

Between September 16th and 23rd, operation of the Cinderace Light Rail and Kamaboko LRT was transferred from SMTR to SLRT.

The S43-Tec LRT, which had been in use until then, will be retired in June 2025 as part of the transition to the MTR4 and replaced with the S43-Tec Stadtbahn. At the same time, odd-numbered trains (excluding one car) will begin operating.

A single-car train began operation in August 2025.

=====Rolling Stock=====
The rolling stock is mainly made up of Stadtbahn trains created by S43-tec and trains created based on them.
There are slight differences depending on the route, but basically all trains are operated interchangeably as long as they are compatible with the platform length.
