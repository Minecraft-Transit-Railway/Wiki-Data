Shimano LRT (zh:縞野軽鐵) is an LRT line owned by [[Terralith Rapid Transit|Terralith Rapid Transit]] (TRT) and operated by [[ShimanoMTR|Shimano LRT]] (the LRT division of SMTR). It has a role to complement the railroad blank area of the route such as SMTR.

This system is based on the old TeufortLRT (TLRT) and has been customized for left-hand traffic. The vehicles were originally S43-Tec LRVs used in the TeufortLRT (TLRT), but they have all been replaced with compatible vehicles made by OTS. However, due to the expansion of the line, a plan is being implemented to buy back all old vehicles by around February.

=====Features=====
  * This line basically plays a complementary role to existing or planned lines with long distances between stations, including lines other than SMTR, so there is a strong tendency to construct it in parallel with the line. ((There are some routes that do not have parallel routes, such as the HG system.))
  * Except for existing stations, there is a strong tendency for station names to be written in Japanese.
  * Unlike SMTR, the construction method is simplified and tends not to create stations with different designs from station to station.
  * As mentioned above, it is compatible with the TLRT and actually once offered direct service to it.
  * In principle, only CJK ((example:"相01")) is indicated as the number, which is different from other LRT lines. ((English notation can be confirmed on the system map.))((The system numbers of the Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation are used as a reference.))
=====History=====
Plans for the first SLRT route were announced on August 21, 2024, and the first section of KR01 opened on August 26 of the same year to commemorate the opening of Utsunomiya LRT.

Through service with Teifot LRT U2 will begin on 13 February 2024.

All routes except for AL02 will be suspended on August 19, 2024. Through services of Teufort LRT and SMTR will also be suspended. In addition, all vehicles in service at the time, except for LRT 1928, will be taken out of service.

The next day, on August 20, the HG route temporarily resumed service with buses. Other routes were gradually resumed with the introduction of compatible LIGHTACE vehicles, and after through service with SMTR resumed on August 29, all SLRT services were restored. On the same day, all vehicles except for 1928 were deregistered. In connection with this, Landfall Station was renamed Kamiyonai Station. Management of the area around the station was transferred from Teufort LRT to TRT.

Between September 16th and 23rd, operation of the Cinderace Light Rail and Kamaboko LRT was transferred from SMTR to SLRT.
=====Rolling Stock=====
All vehicles except for those on the HG route are derived from the S43-tec LRV.
Although there are slight differences depending on the route, basically all vehicles are operated without distinction.

==Shimano MTR Compatible Model==
A model compatible with through service to Shimano MTR.
Unlike the Shimano MTR vehicles mentioned below, these vehicles operate without distinction as long as the tracks are connected.
Currently, all vehicles have a livery modeled on [[https://poppy-playtime.fandom.com/wiki/Smiling_Critters|Smiling Critters]], but currently only the Catnap livery is in operation. Initially, it was planned to modify an S43-LRV, but with the retirement of all the vehicles mentioned above, the plans were changed to building new vehicles instead.

Later, the introduction of the LRV 1973DT, modeled after the Nightmare Critters livery, was announced. Unlike the LRV 1973D, this vehicle has a walk-through head and is designed to operate from a two-car formation. Unlike when SMTR used the S43-LRV, operation is not permitted if all cars do not have gangways, but when forming a train of four or more LRV 1973DTs, if the leading cars are connected with a gangway, through service can be provided.

=====Future plans for MTR4 update=====
The following is mainly a plan after the MTR4 update, and may not be implemented depending on the future situation of LPS.

  * A large-scale update is planned mainly for the S43-Tec-manufactured LRV ((which was out of service from August 2024 to January 2025)), and as a result, LRT 2020 will be replaced with a new vehicle. In addition, some liveries are scheduled to end operation or be changed. ((Due to a major change in the model.))

  * In addition, we plan to insert a 12m intermediate car into S43-Tec and LIGHTACE to operate 3-car and 5-car formations. ((There are platforms where 3-car preparation work is being done on Kamaboko LRT, etc.))
  * Since the addition of the "instant-deploy" function will significantly shorten the period of time that routes will be unable to function due to being stuck, there are plans to switch from the current principle of operating one route per depot to operating multiple routes at the same time.
