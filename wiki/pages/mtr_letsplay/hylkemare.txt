====== Hylkemare Station ======
**Hylkemare** is a overground railway terminal with 9 platforms, serving Moszyan Railways' overground service system. It was built to look like the dutch **Leeuwarden** station, but with two extra terminus platforms. The station later started serving the Lilac Light Rail, via an external tram and bus station called **Hylkemare Station**.

===== Layout =====
The main station has 9 platforms, 2 facing west and the remaining 7 facing east. As of right now, only //Sprinter// services depart west from the station, as the single track to **Hylkemare Wieringawijk** prevents the section from seeing more than one train every 7.5 minutes. Out of the 5 eastbound terminus platforms, it is planned to have at least two be used for //Intercity// services, but for the time being, visitors will see a number Moszyan Railways' rolling stock simply occupying the platforms with no scheduled departure.

To the east of the main entrance is the tram and bus station, serving a municipal bus service based on the //Boskoop Buurtbus//, and a number of //Lilac Light Rail// services. Any trains that cannot turn around at the middle platform continue to the loop at **Hylkemare Oostbaai**.
