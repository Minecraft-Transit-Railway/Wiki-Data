====== Hylkemare Station ======
**Hylkemare** is a overground railway terminal with 9 platforms, serving Moszyan Railways' overground service system. It was built to look like the dutch **Leeuwarden** station, but with two extra terminus platforms. The station will eventually also serve the Lilac Light Rail, via two external stops called **Hylkemare Plazaside** and **Hylkemare Bayside**, in a similar way to how the U-OV Sneltram has stops on two sides of **Utrecht Centraal**.

===== Layout =====
The main station has 9 platforms, 2 facing west and the remaining 7 facing east. As of right now, only //Sprinter// services are permitted to head west from the station, as the single track to **Hylkemare Wieringawijk** prevents the section from seeing more than just //sprinters//. Out of the 5 eastbound terminus platforms, it is planned to have at least two be used for //Intercity// services, but for the time being, visitors will see Moszyan Railways' //Intercity Frontrunner// and //Regional Modern Stock// simply occupying the platforms with no scheduled departure.

To the east of the main entry is the **Hylkemare Plazaside** light rail stop, which will be essential to all eastbound Lilac Light Rail services.

To the northwest of the station will be **Hylkemare Bayside**, planned to be an important connection for north-south services that cannot stop at **Hylkemare Plazaside**.
