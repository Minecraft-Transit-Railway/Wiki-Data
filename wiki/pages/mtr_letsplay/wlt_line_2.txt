**Line 2 (Kwong Chow - North Coast Line)** (Chinese: //二號 (光州 - 北海岸) 綫//), is a rapid transit service operated by [[/West_Lake_Transport_Authority|West Lake Transport Authority]] and future also [[/qingli_railways|Qingli Railways]] (QLR) and [[/cyanex|Cyanex Rapid Transit]] (Cyanex), combining WLT Line 2 and QLR North Coast Line. 

The line colour is <color #000000/#FFDA33>mandarin yellow</color> inspired from real life [[wp>Tung_Chung_line|Tung Chung Line]] and in accordance with the <color #FFFFFF/#EB4881>red</color> colour of Kwong Chow station and the <color #FFFFFF/#EB7AE9>orchid magenta</color> colour of Line 1 (Meyan Line) Phase 1((Magenta mixing with yellow forms red)).

===== History =====

The line is first known as the branch of earliest WLT railway services plan, connecting up [[/Spawn|Spawn]] area with Kwong Chow, via the east shore area of [[/west_lake_area|West Lake]]. It is separated from Line 1 and forms Line 2.

It was originally planned to connect [[/spawn_grand_circular|Spawn Grand Circular]] and [[/weiss_lrt|Weiss LRT]] at [[/red_leaves_station|Red Leaves]] station. However, it changed when [[mtr_community:kettlekettle|Kettle]] rebuilt Spawn and Coast Railway to form part of the [[/auckland_transport|AT Metro]] network. Since the number of connections to Spawn station has increased, and [[/spawn_-_cyan_heights_metropolis|Spawn-Cyan Height Metropolis]] started developing, [[/west_lake_transport_authority|WLT]] decided to accept [[mtr_community:kettlekettle|Kettle]]'s offer of building 2 more platforms at underground level((Later renovated by Jonathan and now known as Zone A)) for Line 2 to terminate. The proposed route as well as location of [[/sai_mo_island_station|Sai Mo Island]] station and [[/see_tsuen_station|See Tsuen]] station was adjusted accordingly, forming the now [[wp>zigzag|zigzag]] lining. 

The idea of merging WLT Line 2 and [[/qingli_railways|QLR]] North Coast Line first came up when QLR offers to [[wp>through_service|through-run]] North Coast Line trains to WLT Line 2. At that time, [[/auckland_transport|AT Metro]] 2209 service((Running between Spawn and Toitoi, now discontinued)) was using only one platform for terminating and outbound trains, causing confusion to passengers and occasional waiting outside the station. There were no independent sections for trains to wait, hence North Coast Line services were also affected.

Feasibility of merging, i.e., the compatibility of two lines, is soon studied. Since WLT Line 2 and North Coast Line are using trains with the same length((100m)) and door spacing((Ex-MTR trains door spacing)), the merge is likely to be successful. The main difference to mitigate is only the [[wp>degree_of_curvature|turn radius]] as well as largest inclination requirement. Changes in track alignmemts and rolling stocks of existing North Coast Line are soon proposed and agreed. 

Merging saves the platform for turning back North Coast Line trains, giving it to AT Metro 2209 service terminating trains. Then, the congestion will be largely relieved. The project is initiated as the early work of WLT Line 2, including the crossings and a pair of 700m tracks west of [[/spawn_station|Spawn]] station, and was done on 3 May 2023. The progress of the sections between Spawn station and [[/forest_peak_station|Forest Peaks]] station, [[/orakei_west_station|Ōrākei West]] station and [[/toitoi_station|Toitoi]] station are also going well. 

After confirmed to merge, WLT Line 2 drops the company name WLT in its naming and adopt a [[wp>shenzhen_metro|Shenzhen Metro]] legacy style naming **Line 2 (Kwong Chow - North Coast Line)**, with reference to the new MRT Line [[wp>Thomson-East_Coast_MRT_Line|Thomson-East Coast Line]] in Singapore. It is expected the other two rapid transit lines built and operated by WLT, Line 1 and Line 3, will follow a similar naming style. 

Before the line is fully ready, a special shuttle service already started between Sai Mo Island station and [[/kwong_chow_station|Kwong Chow]] station, with no intermediate stops, for promoting Kwong Chow to the visitors on Hana-Koshi Line open day 24 June, 2023. After the open day, the service is closed and continues construction, until when Line 1 is undergoing renovation, Line 2 along with the new bus route 4S connecting Sai Mo Island to Spawn-Cyan Height Metropolis((Temporary bus route which will be renamed to 4M and rerouted to serve Museum after Line 2 (Kwong Chow - North Coast Line) opens)) serves as the replacement for transport service to Kwong Chow.

===== Rolling Stocks =====

Similar to Line 1 (Meyan Line), since turn radius is small between West Lake station and See Tsuen station in the final zig-zag lining plan, 4-door trains are used instead of 5-door trains that are currently running on North Coast Line. Existing 6 sets of 5-door C-Train with railway vision livery is gradually rebuilding to 5 sets of 4-door C-Train. 

There are also 1 set of M-Train (phase 2A) and 3 sets of K-Train has started serving passengers. 

Originally, the fleet was planned to include 3 to 5 sets of Shanghai Metro Trains previously running on the North Coast Line. However, as the trains are too tall for the tunnels, they are planned to retire instead as soon as North Coast Line merges with WLT Line 2. Alternatively, 5 sets of phase 2C M-Train will join the fleet, but with an overhaul in the propulsion system, as DC motor is harder to maintenance and consume more electricity. 

Due to the platforms in Cyan Twilight Line((80m long)) can only accomodate 4-car 4-door trains, trains through-running to Cyan Twilight Line and Bond Line need to consist of only 4 cars rather than 5 cars. For promotion of direct access to the Sightseeing Express network, Cyanex Rapid Transit CXD104 is chosen to be the sole rolling stock used for 4-car trains. Yet, ABB //FW D950// traction instead of CRRC Times //tpower-tn3// traction or Alstom //Optonix1500// traction is used for first batch of 4-car trains, possibly because of possible tuning and reliability issue.

===== Operations =====

Trains are all serving from Kwong Chow to Sai Mo Island without intermediate stops. There are a mix of 4-car and 5-car trains running. Passengers can distinguish 5-car only waiting area from 4-car/5-car both applicable waiting area by a different colour line. The upcoming trains information in PIDS also shows the trains are 4-car or 5-car, labelled with <color #7091FF>blue</color> colour and <color #8F6E00>brown</color> colour respectively.

===== Future Plans =====

After the studies on feasibility of merging, it was also found that the maximum signalling headway for original WLT Line 2 sections and North Coast Line sections is similar; however, the maximum train frequency of the North Coast Line is limited by the shared section with AT Metro 2209 Service between Spawn station and [[/forest_peak_station|Forest Peaks]] station. If the service between [[/kwong_chow_station|Kwong Chow]] station and [[/spawn_station|Spawn]] station needed to operate at the maximum possible capacity, WLT Line 2 would need to also merge with AT Metro 2209 Service, or divert some trains away, or turn back some trains at Spawn. 

Option 2 is inspired by the once operated Sightseeing Express - [[/south_continental_line|South Continental Line]] through-running service. It is chosen after more discussions and studies. A branch through-running to [[/cyanex|Cyanex Rapid Transit]]'s Sightseeing Express Line Phase 3 (now [[/sightseeing_express|Cyan Twilight Line]]) was proposed to utilize the slots allocated to AT Metro 2209 Service from Spawn station to Forest Peaks station for remaining sections from Kwong Chow station to Spawn station. 

The branch also makes travelling between [[/west_lake_area|West Lake Area]], and [[/bayside_area|Bayside]], [[/hos_bridge_station|Ho's Bridge]] and [[/chou_wai|Chou Wai]] much more convenient, also reduces the overcrowding in Spawn-Cyan Heights Metropolis and improves player's experience((Saving one out of station interchange between Spawn station and [[/cyan_heights_station|Cyan Heights]] station)). Therefore, although AT Metro later withdraws the 2209 service and leaves the section between Spawn and Forest Peaks to solely North Coast Line, the plan still continues, and is expected to be done along with the merge and official opening of **Line 2 (Kwong Chow - North Coast Line)**.
