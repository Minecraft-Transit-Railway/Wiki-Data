===== Service Pattern =====

Sightseeing Express provides through running service in the following lines:

  * Sumeru Line (CyanEX), from Al-Tighnari to Niloufar
  * Sightseeing Express Line (CyanEX), from West Shore to CyanEX Sakura Stream
  * Azalea-Cyan Line (Azalea Railway), from CyanEX Sakura Stream to Cyan Heights

===== Rolling Stock =====

Services are operated by a fleet of CXD104 trains, with the first 20 sets fitted with Alstom OptONIX 1500 VVVF inverters and subsequent trains fitted with CRRCTEC //t//Power-TN3 VVVF inverters. A new fleet of CXD105 trains with LCD passenger information system installed are currently in production.

===== History =====

Sightseeing Express originally opened as an alternative route of the original Sightseeing Line (now Sightseeing Local Line), to reduce the travel time from [[Cyan Heights]] to [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]]. It then received several extensions, firstly from [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]] to [[West Shore]], then the through operation with Sumeru Line, and finally from [[Cyan Heights]] to [[Twilight Spruce]] and the through operation with Bond Line.

This service used to take the name of **Sightseeing Express Line**, but was subsequently renamed to **Sightseeing Express** to better align with its status of a through running system.
