**Lake City Station** (//Chinese: 湖城站//) is a terminal station of 4 lines, including [[mtr_letsplay:wr_sw_plains_line|WR SW Plains Line]], [[mtr_letsplay:lakeside_mystic_line|Lakeside Mystic Line]], [[mtr_letsplay:cin_gyun_line|Cin Gyun Line]], and [[mtr_letsplay:circulator_ip|Circulator IP]]. It is frequently used for intro and outro of Jonathan's videos.

The station is split into 2 parts, the "[[mtr_letsplay:wilds_railway|Wilds Railway]] side" which contains the elevated [[mtr_letsplay:wr_sw_plains_line|WR SW Plains Line]] platform and "[[mtr_letsplay:qingli_railways|New Harmony Railways]] side" which contains the  [[mtr_letsplay:lakeside_mystic_line|Lakeside Mystic Line]] and [[mtr_letsplay:cin_gyun_line|Cin Gyun Line]] due to the existing WR side is not enough for expansion. 

Unless specified, the elevated [[mtr_letsplay:wr_sw_plains_line|WR SW Plains Line]] Lake City station will be referred as "WR Side", and the underground [[mtr_letsplay:lakeside_mystic_line|Lakeside Mystic Line]] and [[mtr_letsplay:cin_gyun_line|Cin Gyun Line]] Lake City station will be referred as "NHR Side". 

===== History =====

  * **8 August, 2022**: WR side Station starts construction. [[mtr_community:staff:navi_lx9702|Navi]] (Wilds Railway) is responsible for this work. The elevated station is said to be "Ma On Shan Line style". A few advertisements boards are posted on the Platform 1 and is removed later.
  * **Unknown August, 2022**: NHR side Station starts construction. [[mtr_community:superidolabc|Superidolabc]] is responsible for this work at the moment which is still the [[mtr_letsplay:ldr_land_side_line|LDR Land Side Line]]. In view of his expulsion the station is then managed by Tea, and the [[mtr_letsplay:ldr_land_side_line|LDR Land Side Line]] is replaced by [[mtr_letsplay:lakeside_mystic_line|Lakeside Mystic Line]].
  * **Unknown November, 2022**: [[mtr_community:ludwigtails|LudwigTails]] asked for permission for his first line to be terminated there and is agreed, therefore the [[mtr_letsplay:cin_gyun_line|Cin Gyun Line]] platforms are built underneath [[mtr_letsplay:lakeside_mystic_line|Lakeside Mystic Line]] platforms in NHR side Station.
  * **4 December, 2022**: the [[mtr_letsplay:circulator_ip|Circulator IP]], regarding as the first "Airplane" line in the server, connects Lake City Station with an separated AirDock next to the RV [[mtr_lp:mpl_85|MPL 85]].
