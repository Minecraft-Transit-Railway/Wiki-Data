**East Midlands Railway** is a train operating company on the Minecraft Transit Railway Let's Play server. It operates services from Llanmara Prince's Street to Ilford Island, as well as regional services around the Liskeard area, alongside long-distance and stopping services towards the North-West from Liskeard Central. The operator replaced the now-defunct Electrostar Rail brand.
