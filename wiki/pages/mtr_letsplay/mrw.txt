|//Froastepoarte was the first station constructed by Szandor, overhauled from the original Lilac Light Rail stop to look like Lansingerland-Zoetermeer.//|
|{{mtr_letsplay:hylkemareplatforms.png?1000|Hylkemare Station, as seen from the back wall of the station building, just past the paygates.}}|
|//Hylkemare is the first main transit hub on the network, with the 7 eastbound platforms planned for future use.//|
|{{mtr_letsplay:hylkemarewieringawijk.png?1000|GET BOSKOOP SNIJDELWIJK'D}}|
|//Hylkemare Wieringawijk is kind of a double joke, the length of the name is a reference to Leeuwarden Camminghaburen, considering the main station is built after Leeuwarden, but the station itself is a relatively accurate replica of the community's favorite dutch meme station, Boskoop Snijdelwijk.//|
