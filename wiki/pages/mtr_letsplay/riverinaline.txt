====== Riverina Line ======
The **Riverina Line** is a railway corridor spanning between the cities of [[mtr_letsplay:gapyeong|Gapyeong]] and [[mtr_letsplay:albury|Albury]]. Its name stems from the originally exclusive Riverina Regional service (now the Riverina Sprinter, to be renamed to Moszyan Railways Sprinter) that ran until [[mtr_letsplay:culcairn|Culcairn]]. In 2024, ownership of multiple lines in the area was transferred and service extended towards the city of Albury, requiring multiple rebuilds from the originally two-track line into 4 in some places.
