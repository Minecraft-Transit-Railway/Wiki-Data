====== Fryske Line ======
The **Fryske Line**((lit. "Frisian Line")) is an overground railway corridor constructed as first project by Moszyan Railways. The line was made to be a simple connection from the later-constructed Hylkemare station towards the Taipa area of the Let's Play Server. The line is known for using frisian naming conventions for its station names.

===== History =====
On December 12th, the first plan for the line was published, simply mentioned as the first stage of the Moszyan Railways Overground network. The plan showed a line going from **Shuangmen Xuegui** station (now **Froastpoarte**) to multiple stations on a horizontal line eastward. The map also featured a planned section of side-by-side running tracks between Moszyan Railways and the Lilac Light Rail.

On December 26th, the line officially recieved the name "Fryske Line".

On January 28th, an updated plan map for the line was posted. It showed that the plan for the line had temporarily been shortened to ending at **Hylkemare** until a suitable solution could be found for the fact that bad planning initially had the line planned for at least a kilometer or two of over-sea travel.

On February 6th and 8th, it was announced that an originally unplanned new station was to be constructed on the line, going by the name **De Marren**.((lit. "The Lakes")) After that, the plan for a station over the lake in the yellowstone biome was dropped.
