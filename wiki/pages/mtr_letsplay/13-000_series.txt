 The Terralith Rapid Transit 13-000 series is an electric multiple unit (EMU) train type that was formerly operated by the [[ShimanoMTR]](SMTR) on the [[Jigglypuff Line]].
=====Overview=====
When the Jigglypuff Line was constructed, direct service with the SLRT was implemented for convenience, but at the time of planning, the line was only capable of handling S43-Tec light rail vehicles.

Therefore, Metro Ace modified the S43-Tec 1980 with the following items.

  * Installation of SMTR standard CS-ATC to provide through service to SMTR.

  * Installed ATO compatible with GoA-2 to accommodate platform doors.

  * Control device updated from chopper control to IGBT-VVVF.

  * Replace the motor from DC motor to AC induction motor.

  * Motor output increased from 100kw to 120kw. This increased the design maximum speed from 80km/h to 90km/h.

  * DC 600V/1500V dual voltage for through service to SLRT and SMTR.

  * In order to comply with SMTR, an emergency door is installed in the front.

  * Renovated exterior and interior.

The 13-000 Series was born as a result of the above-mentioned large-scale renovation.
=====Operation, disposal, and return.=====
It debuted with the start of Jigglypuff Line operation in September 2023. It provided through service to stations up to Acacia Village on AC01 and almost the entire line on KR01.

It was suddenly suspended along with other SLRTs on August 19, 2024. It was scrapped on August 29 of the same year.

However, not all of the cars were scrapped, and some were stored in a warehouse, but were revived as SLRT-exclusive cars six months later. The reason they are not included in the SMTR is that after the replacement in August 2024, all cars will be limited to cars that make up a four-car through train with gangways. As a result, equipment only used for SMTR, such as ATO, has been removed. Also, the paint is mostly the same as before, but the TRT logo has been painted over.

The S43-Tec LRT was subsequently replaced by the S43-Tec Stadtbahn, and all of the cars were subsequently discontinued. The Stadtbahn 1980mod, which corresponds to the successor vehicle, currently has no plans to paint it pink.

The successor, the TRT13-100 series, largely inherits the paintwork and door shape of this model.
