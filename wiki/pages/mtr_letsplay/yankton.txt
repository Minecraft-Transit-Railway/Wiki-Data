**Yankton Station** (//Chinese: 楊克頓站//) is a station of 7 lines, including [[mtr_letsplay:snowie_line|Snowie Line]], [[mtr_letsplay:snowtral_line|Snowtral Line]], [[mtr_letsplay:wanton_line|Wanton Line]], [[mtr_letsplay:lakeside_mystic_line|Lakeside Mystic Line]], [[mtr_letsplay:south_continental_line|South Continental Line]], [[mtr_letsplay:hsr_northern_heights_line|HSR Northern Heights Line]], [[mtr_letsplay:hsr_southern_cross_line|HSR Southern Cross Line]]. It is one of the most busiest and nostalgic station in the Let's Play Server.

The station is split into 2 phases, the Main Metro Phase and the High Speed Railway Phase. There is APM Service and passageway connected both phases.

There is a station art, "Yankton Circuit", in the middle of the main concourse where it shows the line colours passing through Yankton Station. An interesting fact is that although HSR platforms are in underground, it is designed to be the look of ground platforms.
