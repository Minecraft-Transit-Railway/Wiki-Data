=====History=====
On 9 May 2023, Route 736 was added to the Tempest light rail system project together with [[lrt_735|route 735]]. This route was suggested by [[qingli_railways|Qingli Railways]] to connect Tempest station to Sunrise through the upper loop of [[lrt_717_8|route 717/718]].

On 19 May 2023, Route 736P was proposed to be the local route of route 736, terminating at Tao Tung stop instead of going up the McHenry link to Sunrise.

On 9 July 2023, route 736 and 736P are completed and fully operational together with the whole Tempest light rail network.

On 20 October 2023, [[qingli_railways|Qingli Railways]] proposed the "Lilac Light Rail Reform Plan 2023". According to the plan, Route 736 will be unchanged, but Route 736P will be merged with route 761 such that the southern terminus of the route will be extended to Daimon North.
