**Kwong Chow Station** (Chinese: //光州站//) is a station in the [[mtr_letsplay:west_lake_area|West Lake Area]] built by [[mtr_community:staff:bdark000|BDark000]] on behalf of [[/west_lake_transport_authority|West Lake Transport Authority (WLT)]]. It is the western terminus of [[/wlt_line_2|Line 2 (Kwong Chow - North Coast Line)]] and the southern terminus of [[mtr_letsplay:wlt_line_1|Line 1 (Meyan Line) Phase 1]]. It will become a mid-way stop of Line 1 (Meyan Line) after the phase 2 is done. 
The station gets featured for a couple of times in Jonathan's videos((Including [[https://youtu.be/viNwYsPHCMM?si=CPl1iiftCtc7TQSZ|Let's Play S2 Finale]] //(starting from 1:07:30)//, [[https://youtu.be/iWnGgoS7Dhc?si=6a7sSB-QkK0uO_YZ|5 Amazing Minecraft Train Stations]] //(starting from 12:12)// and [[https://youtu.be/mlC4KZOtOEM?si=FBrL7nl0qZpJz1ZH|Let's Play S3E25]] //(starting from 54:18)// )). 

===== History =====

When [[/west_lake_transport_authority|WLT]]'s first plan regarding transportation in the [[/west_lake_area|West Lake Area]], the region near now Kwong Chow station is already planned to 

==== Timeline ====
  * early September, 2022: Station starts designing. It was originally designed to be a island platform with at least 27m wide, serving [[/wlt_line_1|Line 1 (Meyan Line)]] (called WLT Line 1 at that time), with a pair of stacked tracks of [[/wlt_line_2|Line 2 (Kwong Chow - North Coast Line)]] (called WLT Line 2 at that time) crossing in the middle. Passengers alighting from Line 2, can exit on either side to change to Line 1 trains for the two directions on the opposite, or exit the station. Conversely, passengers changing from both directions of Line 1 can enjoy a "cross platform interchange" to Line 2. 
  * mid October, 2022: The platforms design and layout is revised to how it looks now. It is due to large height differences between both [[/chung_kwo_kok_station|Chung Kwo Kok]] station on Line 1, [[/sha_tsui_station|Sha Tsui]] station on Line 2 and Kwong Chow station. There is no enough space for Line 1 southbound tracks to cross (over or under) Line 2 tracks and arrive at the designated position (east side of Kwong Chow station). Line 1 tracks are then decided to put at the west side to eliminate all possibilities of crossing Line 2, to keep track alignments simple. Meanwhile, the cross platform interchange between Line 2 and Line 1 sections north of Kwong Chow is retained, and Line 1 sections south of Kwong Chow is forgone, in accordance to the [[/ckk_and_wyi_plan|Chung Kwo Kok and Wong Yip Island Development Plan]] as well as more developments of other builders from [[/northern_snow_village_station|Northern Snow Village]] station to [[/birch_hill_station|Birch Hill]] station than from [[/yuen_chow_kok_station|Yuen Chow Kok]] station to [[/suet_yuen_station|Suet Yuen]] station. 
  * 22 December, 2022: Station is open to the public as well as the extension of WLT Line 1 Phase 1 from Birch Hill station to this station. 
  * early January, 2023: Step-free access is now fully available after a new lift exit is added to Exit D. 
  * 24 June, 2023: Line 2 (Kwong Chow - North Coast Line) runs a shuttle service (later known as W. Section Temp Shuttle) between this station and [[/sai_mo_island_station|Sai Mo Island]] station. It is the first day of the station providing cross platform interchange. 
  * early December, 2023: A small renovation on the stairs is done. Most of the staircases in the station are extended and leave a small space in the middle for better safety and passengers experience. Also, the downward escalator from south concourse to platform 1 has been removed and become part of the staircase for better crowd control. 

===== Layout =====

Not counting exits, there are a total of 3 floors in the station. **L1** is concourse and is separated into north and south part not directly accessible to each other, due to [[/kwong_chow_grand_canal|the Grand Canal]] in between. North part connects Exit C, D while south part connects Exit A, B. **L2** and **L3** are platforms under the canal. 

Platforms 1, 3 stack on top of platforms 2, 4 on the two sides. In between is the core structure. Under the concourse on two ends, it consists of walls, passages, staircases and escalators. Under the canal, it has the famous high ceiling spacious and open design, with chandeliers hung between the pillars. To facilitate the interchange at the upper platforms, a passageway in the middle is built to further connect up platforms 1 and 3. And since future interchange between [[mtr_letsplay:wlt_line_1|Line 1 (Meyan Line)]] south of Kwong Chow and [[mtr_letsplay:wlt_line_2|Line 2 (Kwong Chow - North Coast Line)]] requires going down from upper platforms to lower platforms, a staircase and two escalators connecting the two floors are also built. 

One lift is serving between north concourse and the platforms, while another is serving between south concourse and the platforms. The lift serving south concourse is larger due to a higher anticipated passengers flow and capacity needed.
