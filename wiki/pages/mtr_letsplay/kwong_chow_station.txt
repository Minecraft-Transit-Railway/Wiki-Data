**Kwong Chow Station** (Chinese: 光州站) is a station in the [[mtr_letsplay:west_lake_area|West Lake Area]] built by [[mtr_community:bdark000|BDark000]]. It is the western terminus of [[/wlt_line_2|Line 2 (Kwong Chow - North Coast Line)]] and the southern terminus of [[mtr_letsplay:wlt_line_1|Line 1 (Meyan Line) Phase 1]]. It will become a mid-way stop of Line 1 (Meyan Line) after the phase 2 is done. 
The station gets featured for a couple of times in Jonathan's videos((Including [[https://youtu.be/viNwYsPHCMM?si=CPl1iiftCtc7TQSZ|Let's Play S2 Finale]] //(starting from 1:07:30)//, [[https://youtu.be/iWnGgoS7Dhc?si=6a7sSB-QkK0uO_YZ|5 Amazing Minecraft Train Stations]] //(starting from 12:12)// and [[https://youtu.be/mlC4KZOtOEM?si=FBrL7nl0qZpJz1ZH|Let's Play S3E25]] //(starting from 54:18)// )). 

===== History =====

  * early September, 2022: Station starts designing. It was originally designed to be a island platform with at least 27m wide, serving Line 1 (Meyan Line), with a pair of stacked tracks of Line 2 (Kwong Chow - North Coast Line) crossing in the middle. Passengers alighting from Line 2 (Kwong Chow - North Coast Line), can exit on either side to change to Line 1 (Meyan Line) trains for the two directions on the opposite, or exit the station. Conversely, passengers changing from both directions of Line 1 (Meyan Line) can enjoy a "cross platform interchange" to Line 2 (Kwong Chow - North Coast Line).  
  * early December, 2023: A small renovation on the stairs is done. Most of the staircases in the station are extended and leave a small space in the middle for better safety and passengers experience. Also, the downward escalator from south concourse to platform 1 has been removed and become part of the staircase for better crowd control. 

===== Layout =====

Not counting exits, there are a total of 3 floors in the station. **L1** is concourse and is separated into north and south part not directly accessible to each other, due to [[/kwong_chow_grand_canal|the Grand Canal]] in between. North part connects Exit C, D while south part connects Exit A, B. **L2** and **L3** are platforms under the canal. 

Platforms 1, 3 stack on top of platforms 2, 4 on the two sides. In between is the core structure. Under the concourse on two ends, it consists of walls, passages, staircases and escalators. Under the canal, it has the famous high ceiling spacious and open design, with chandeliers hung between the pillars. To facilitate the interchange at the upper platforms, a passageway in the middle is built to further connect up platforms 1 and 3. And since future interchange between [[mtr_letsplay:wlt_line_1|Line 1 (Meyan Line)]] south of Kwong Chow and [[mtr_letsplay:wlt_line_2|Line 2 (Kwong Chow - North Coast Line)]] requires going down from upper platforms to lower platforms, a staircase and two escalators connecting the two floors are also built. 

One lift is serving between north concourse and the platforms, while another is serving between south concourse and the platforms. The lift serving south concourse is larger due to a higher anticipated passengers flow and capacity needed.
