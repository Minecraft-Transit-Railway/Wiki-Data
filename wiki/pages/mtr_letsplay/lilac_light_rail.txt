====== Lilac Light Rail ======

The Lilac Light Rail, also known as the Eastern Light Rail Transit System (Lilac LRT), is a light rail system in the Let’s Play Server, serving mainly the eastern and the northeastern side of the Let’s Play Server. It is a combination of Lilypad Light Rail and Qingli Light Rail (formerly Kallos Light Rail) which were owned by Lilypad Rail and Qingli Railways respectively. Currently the system is jointly owned by both companies.

===== History =====

When Kallos is developed in August 2022, the New Harmony Railways reserved space for building a small Light Rail Platform when constructing Kallos station. New Harmony Railways immediately released a proposal for a light rail [[lrt_801|route 801]] (later changed to 802) running from Kallos to Kallos Ferry Pier, a new pier in Kallos area also constructed by New Harmony Railways. After some research, construction commenced on 1 August 2022.

Kallos Light Rail [[lrt_801|Route 801]] was completed and fully operational on 5 August 2022. The route runs from Kallos to Kallos Ferry Pier, and serving some villages between, just according to the plan. Light Rail Vehicles will turn back when reaching Kallos Ferry Pier stop, to another turn back rail in the Northwest of the stop, then return to Kallos by the opposite track.

On 11 August 2022, Route 801 has been splittd into 2 routes, [[lrt_801|801]] and 801P. The terminus of Route 801 was changed to Karest Lake Beach, while Route 801P remained terminating at Kallos Ferry Pier. On the same day, New Harmony Railways announced that [[lrt_801|route 801]] will be extended to Eden, together with 2 new routes, 101 and 102, to form the Eden Circular around Eden station. The Eden plan completed on 20 August 2022.

On 13 August 2022, New Harmony Railways proposed to extend route 801P to Puketeraki and interchange with AT Metro. The construction started on 20 August 2022. On 3 September, Chin Ka Village light rail (Route 762) was completed which runs between Toitoi and Lei Yue Mun, owned by Jonathan Railway Authorities. New Harmony Railways released a proposal next day of setting up a peak hour route running from Kallos to Puketeraki, Toitoi, and continue to run on tracks of Route 762 until Lei Yue Mun. The route number of this route was later decided to be 801X. Also, as the number of routes terminating at Kallos increase, the original platforms cannot hold the amount of trains anymore. As a result, a Kallos LRT Depot stop is also proposed to be built in the West of Kallos station, consisting 12 Light Rail platforms. On 10 September 2022, Route 801X entered service and it became the first route to terminate at Kallos LRT Depot. The terminus of other routes were also moved on the next day.

On 17 September 2022, New Harmony Railways released a new proposal of a new route running from Kallos LRT Depot to Enchanted South Hill, together with an upgrade on Kallos LRT Depot station to a High Speed Rail stop. The new station completed together with Route 810 and both entered service on 10 October 2022. Another proposal of a new route connecting Kallos with Jonathan’s Resort was dropped on 19 September 2022, and it became fully operational since 7 November 2022.

On 24 November 2022, New Harmony Railways cooperated with Hi-Sko to extend route 801P to Hot Springs, and assign a new route to throughrun with Schwartz LRT till Icesert Estate. On 24 November 2022, New Harmony Railways announced that the frequency of Route 801P will be increased to the same as the other routes and the route number will be changed to 802. The through run route was also named Route 802S. Also, as the extension of Route 802 included Toitoi as one of the mid stops, the Route 801X no longer provide more efficiency to passengers. As a result, Route 801X would also be removed when Route 802 extension/ Route 802S was fully operational. This plan completed on 4 December 2022.

On 25 January 2023, as [[kallos_express|Kallos Express]] had been extended to Tempest, a new light rail route, 761, was proposed to serve that area. This route runs from Tempest to Daimon North, and would be the first light rail route to use 750V DC overhead wire cables. Route 761 was fully operational since 5 February 2023.

On 29 January 2023, the transit connection between South Memorial and Makki Memorial Village has been classified as a light rail route. The route number was decided to be 505.

On 3 February 2023, Qingli Railways released a big proposal connecting Tempest, Jonathan’s Resort, and Heung Fan Liu Airport. This includes Route 882 extending to Airport South stop, New Route 720 running from Daimon North to Airport North, and a peak hour Route 482P running from Jonathan’s Resort to Airport North. Another new special route, 578E, would also be added, which runs from South Memorial to Tempest. This plan first connected the whole Lilypad and Qingli light rail systems.

On 6 February 2023, Lilypad Rail proposed a new route 492 starting from Jonathan’s Resort to Bridge Bay. This is the first light rail route serving the west of Jonathan’s Resort. On the same day, Qingli Railways also announced to cooperate with Lilypad Rail to operate a new peak hour light rail route 483P running from Chou Wai to Light Rail Depot. The Jonathan’s Resort to Chou Wai track section was completed on 10 February 2023, thus Route 492 (to Chou Wai) and 483P became fully operational. A bus (later labelled 41K) was also opened from Chou Wai LRT stop to Chou Wai City on this day, as the Chou Wai LRT stop is quite a distance from the city the stop is meant to serve. Bus extensions north of Chou Wai City are under construction.

On 9 February 2023, Qingli Railways and Lilypad Rail released the first cooperative proposal of a new route 410. This route was co-owned by Lilypad Rail and Qingli Railways, and goes from Enchanted South Hill to Bridge Bay, but not via Jonathan’s Resort. Instead, 2 new stations, Ginza and Yurine will be built to connect Blackland and Yin Pan Tsuen. This route became fully operational since late February.

On 14 February 2023, Lilypad Rail released the Phase 2 of West Resort light rail system. This includes a new route 405 from Bridge Bay to Belvedere. This route completed on 18 February together with the track section from Chou Wai to Bridge Bay.

On 21 February 2023, Qingli Railways proposed the second Co-owning route with Lilypad Rail, which is route 633. This route aims to create a direction between Resort and New Buckingham, so that the route runs from Jonathan’s Resort to Taipa, a new station in New Buckingham area connecting to Taipa South station of AT Regional. This connection completed on 7 May 2023 together with the new Taipa LR Depot.

On 4 March 2023, Route 720, Route 882 extension and Route 482P went fully operational. The Tempest Light Rail system was officially connected to the rest of the tracks.

On 4 April 2023, Lilypad Rail started a big project at Tempest. This started with a new route 717 from Tempest to Sunrise via a 3 quarter clockwise loop. The project developed quickly and the following changes are made:\\ - 717 forms a complete loop and splits into 2 circular route, 717 and 718\\ - A smaller loop is built at the southwest of the big loop, and forms 2 circular route, 721 and 722, namely “Tempest South Circular”\\ - Qingli Railways proposed 2 new routes, 735 and 736. 735 runs from Sunrise to Dynamic (in the west of the loop) via the horizontal diameter of the bigger loop. 736 runs from Tempest to Sunrise, via 2 quarter of the smaller loop in anti clockwise direction, then continue via the bigger loop in clockwise direction.\\ - A new station near Dynamic, Tao Tung, is built for terminating trains of Route 721, 722, 735.\\ - Qingli Railways proposed a shorter version of route 736, which was later assigned with the route number 736P, running from Tempest to Tao Tung.\\ **- As the number of collaborative lines are much more than expected, Lilypad Rail suggested to co-own the Lilypad Light Rail and Qingli Light Rail systems. Qingli Railways accepted this idea. This plan was implemented soon after the confirmation of this proposal. The system is then renamed into Lilac Light Rail system.**

On 10 April 2023, construction began on Route 992. Originally, Route 992's alignment was planned as a ferry from Exchange Place to Royal Shore via Badgerstown and the backside of Blacklea Mountain. Construction on the ferry pier at Exchange Place was already completed at that time. However, it was decided instead to create a Light Rail route. S43-Tec Light Rail vehicles were chosen for the route as the layout of the former ferry pier would not have allowed for Hong Kong LRVs. The line was opened between Exchange Place and Wald-Tafelberge on 11 April 2023, with extensions initially planned for later phases towards Old Depot and West Llanthrow stations.

On 30 April 2023, during the construction of the South Continental Line, Lilypad Rail had made an assessment and released a plan to connect Winry and Ishima stations. The former is the terminus of the Blau LRT, and the latter being a stop on the South Continental Line. The line was thus named "Blau LRT Branch Line" despite not being connected track-wise to the original Blau LRT.

On 6 May 2023, the Blau LRT Branch Line opened using S43-Tec Light Rail vehicles.

On 9 May 2023, the Blau LRT Branch Line was converted to Lilac Light Rail Route 115, and the line was converted to use Hong Kong LRVs. Initially, it was planned to intersect the existing Light Rail network at Yi Lok, however, due to heritage trackage being in the way of an easy connection, Route 115 was instead routed via a new stop at Yi Nam before intersecting existing tracks south of Yi Yao. Yi Nam station is parallel to part of the existing heritage trackage. Route 115 was temporarily extended to Yi Long, the future location of the permanent Route 115 depot. The full plan will see Route 115 extend to Hot Springs via Izu and Spruce Forest, however, construction is ongoing in the Karest Lake area, so Route 115 remains routed temporarily to Yi Long station. This extension opened on 10 May 2023.

The whole Tempest plan was completed on 9 July 2023. Route T717 was also installed at Sunrise station to transport passengers from platform 5 to platform 6, as well as to allow trains to switch platforms and change from routes 717 to 718.

On 20 October 2023, Qingli Railways proposed the "Lilac Light Rail Reform Plan 2023". This includes the following plans: \\ - Removal of [[lrt_101|route 101]] \\ - Extension of [[lrt_115|route 115]] to Hot Springs, and set up a new route 115D for trains going back to Yi Long Depot. \\ - Removal of [[lrt_482p|route 482P]] \\ - Extension of [[lrt_578e|route 578E]] to Sunrise \\ - New [[lrt_601|route 601]] from Jonathan's Resort to Loyalty Hills, to replace [[lrt_482p|route 482P]] \\ - New [[lrt_633|route 633P]] from Taipa to Belvedere\\ - New [[lrt_719|route 715]] from Daimon North to Loyalty Hills, being a placeholder before [[lrt_719|route 719]] gets into service \\ - New route [[lrt_719|route 719]] from Tao Tung to Loyalty Hills \\ - New route [[lrt_719|route 719P]] from Tao Tung to Eastwich-on-sea \\ - Extend [[lrt_720|route 720]] to Jonathan's Resort \\ - Removal of [[lrt_721_2|route 721, 722]] \\ - Extension of [[lrt_735|route 735]] to Daimon North \\ - Merge [[lrt_736|route 736P]] with [[lrt_761|route 761]] \\ - New [[lrt_801|route 801P]] from Light Rail Depot to Winry \\ - New [[lrt_803|route 803]] from Light Rail Depot to South Memorial \\ - New [[lrt_804|route 804]] from Taipa to Kallos via Light Rail Depot, and removal of Kallos stop from route [[lrt_801|801]], [[lrt_802|802]]\\ - Shorten [[lrt_882|route 882]] to Jonathan's Resort\\ - Extension of [[lrt_992|route 992]] to Old Depot

On 22 October 2023, the track connection between Spruce Forest and Puketeraki is completed. Route 115 is extended to Hot Springs. Route 115D also entered service for trains going back to the Depot.

On 23 October 2023, Loyalty Hills Light Rail Terminal is completed. Route 715 entered service, running from Daimon Island to Loyalty Hills.

On 29 October 2023, Royal Park is completed for future connections to Elizabeth Line. Routes 483P, 801, 802, 810, 882 serve this stop. Routes 803 and 804 were later added to the roster of routes that call at this station.

On 1 November 2023, Kallos stop is removed from routes 801, 802 and 802S, and the following day, Route 804 entered service, running between Taipa and Kallos/Light Rail Depot.

On 11 December 2023, Lilypad Rail proposed the "Lilac Light Rail Southern Corridor Expansion Plan," which included extensions of the light rail south from: \\ - Kuk Wu via Diamond Creek & West Tung Suet Chau. \\ - Satoyama via Polar Place. \\ - Tempest via Polar Place \\ Until all lines come together at Zein station. A four-track section was included between Kuk Wu and Zein, and new "luxury"/"limited" service bypass trackage was created along a slightly different alignment to existing local trackage between Kuk Wu and Sunrise. The Southern Corridor plan also included plans to extend the Light Rail south to Hylkemare, Gecko Plaza, and Eastville Junction. A branch to Ostania was also included in the plan. Provisions for an east-west extension from Taipa to Gecko Plaza was also included, but won't be constructed initially and will have its own proposal. \\ Phase 1 of construction between existing Light Rail stations in the north and the merge at Zein was outlined and began construction on 7 April 2024. 

On 13 March 2024, Route 992 was extended from Wald-Tafelberge to Old Depot with an intermediate stop at Grumbler's Grove.

On 7 April 2024, Route 201 and 202 entered service, running between Eastwich Ferry Pier (or Eastwich-on-Sea) and Rhoam Coast.

On 16 April 2024, Route P300 entered service, running between Sunrise and Kuk Wu. It was the first premium express light rail route, and it runs fully on the rapid tracks.

On 26 April 2024, the track connection between Kuk Wu and Zein was completed. Route P300 was extended from Kuk Wu to Zein with an intermediate stop at West Tung Suet Chau. Route 300 entered service, running between Sunrise and Zein. Route 271P was extended from Tao Tung to Zein via One-man Island and Kuk Wu, and Tao Tung stop was removed.

On 28 April 2024, the track connection between Satoyama, Tempest and Zein was completed. Route 761 changed its route after Tempest, terminating at Zein instead of Tao Tung. Route 271 was extended from Tao Tung to Zein via One-man Island and Satoyama, and Tao Tung stop was removed.

On 4 May 2024, Route 771X entered service, running between Tao Tung and Zein via One-man Island and Kuk Wu. It runs on the rapid tracks between Kuk Wu and Zein, so it's called a 'Regional Express'.

**Special Services:** \\ {{115D.png?50&direct}} : Winry ⇄ Yi Yao\\ (Special route to allow 115 trains to travel from and back to Yi Long Depot)\\ {{578E.png?50&direct}} : South Memorial ⇄ %%Sunrise%%\\ (Has a frequency of around 2 hours, a special route to through run on the whole eastern light rail system) \\ {{802S.png?50&direct}} : Light Rail Depot ⇄ Icesert Estate\\ (Has a frequency of 1 hour, through runs on Hi-Sko Schwarz LRT from Hot Springs until Icesert Estate) \\ {{:mtr_letsplay:t717.png?50&direct}} : Sunrise Platform 5 → Sunrise Platform 6\\ (Special single-direction route to allow 717 trains to switch onto 718)

**Discontinued Services:** \\ - **801X** : Light Rail Depot to Lei Yue Mun, put into service on 10 September 2022, through runs on Chin Ka Village Light Rail (Route 762) from Toitoi to Lei Yue Mun. As route 802 is extended to Toitoi on 4 December 2022, this route is discontinued because it can no longer provide more efficiency for passengers. \\ - **643** : Taipa to Light Rail Depot (above-ground platforms) via Royal Park in Light Rail Depot direction, and direct to Mou Lun in Taipa direction. Was in service for less than one day as a public test route during the construction of the Taipa-Kallos connection, but construction on the 804 route was completed in time for full open service without the temporary 643 route.

**Shelved lines:** \\ - **719P (first generation)** : Tempest to Eastwich-on-sea (via Toodeepic Ocean), as it was just completely overlapping 736P without bringing any benefits to the light rail system, this route was set aside. \\ - **723P** : Tao Tung -> Sunrise (via Big Stick), this was a depot route planned to let trains carry passengers when gonig back to Sunrise depot from Tao Tung. In the final plan, the last instruction of Sunrise Depot was set to be 735 towards Sunrise, this depot route was no longer needed and was set aside.\\ - **802K**: Light Rail Depot to South Memorial. This route was raised by Qingli Railways to connect the 505 Memorial loop to the main light rail system, with a 15 minute frequency. This route plan was soon replaced by 578E which goes from South Memorial to Tempest. This route has been raised again in the "Lilac Light Rail Reform Plan 2023" as the frequency of 578E is far from enough to carry passengers out of the Memorial area to other light rail stops.

**Planned Services:** \\ - **601** : Jonathan's Resort to Loyalty Hills, used to replace route 482P and upgrade to normal service.\\ - **633P** : Taipa to Belvedere, just to provide a more efficient connection.\\ - **719** : Tao Tung to Loyalty Hills, to serve the new Loyalty Hills Terminal. \\ - **719P** : Tao Tung to Eastwich-on-sea, will be opened when Eastwich-on-sea is completed.\\ - **801P** : Light Rail Depot to Winry.\\ - **803** : Light Rail Depot to South Memorial, mentioned above.
