===== History =====

Route 719 was first proposed on 23 April 2023, when [[lrt_717_8|routes 717 and 718]] were under planning. At that time Tao Tung stop was not planned, and Route 719 was planned to run between Dynamic stop and Eastwich-on-sea stop.

The first generation of Route 719P was proposed later on 9 May 2023, which is an extension of route 719 to Tempest via Silicon Valley stop. On the same day, the extra terminating platform at Dynamic is renamed to a independent station, Tao Tung. The terminus of route 719 was then changed to Tao Tung stop instead of Dynamic stop.

The construction of these 2 lines didn’t start even for now because the construction of Eastwich-on-sea stop by [[lilypad_rail]] has never started.

On 1 July 2023, the plan of the first generation of Route 719P was announced to be abandoned as it was just overlapping with [[lrt_736|route 736P]] without bringing any benefits to the light rail system.

Meanwhile, in 29 March 2023, Lilypad Rail released a plan for the Blossom East Line, which was planned to intersect the Light Rail between Ho Shing and Wai Tam stations at San Shek Wan within the plan. Lilypad Rail chose the location to allow passengers to conveniently access the diving pool and rainbow slide found at San Shek Wan. However, due to Loyalty Hills lending much more favourably to a high-usage interchange between Blossom East Line and Marble Line, Lilypad Rail released a plan on 14 April 2023 to redirect Blossom East Line via Loyalty Hills. Finally, on 29 June 2023, Lilypad Rail and Qingli Railways decided to allow Blossom East Line to interchange at Loyalty Hills, and to create a Light Rail terminal to compensate for a north-south connection.

On 20 October 2023, [[qingli_railways|Qingli Railways]] released the "Lilac Light Rail Reform Plan 2023", and this plan included the route 719 and the second generation of route 719P. Route 719 is extended to Loyalty Hills from its original plan, and route 719P is exactly the same as the original 719 plan, running between Tao Tung stop and Eastwich-on-sea stop.

On 23 October 2023, Loyalty Hills light rail terminal is completed. However, there are still no available depots for route 719, so that [[lilypad_rail]] arranged a new route 715 running from Daimon North to Loyalty Hills, to be the placeholder of route 719 until a suitable depot for route 719 is found. Route 715 is using Daimon North Depot currently, sharing rolling stock with [[lrt_720|route 720]]. East San Shek Wan station is also added to the Loyalty Hills Light Rail plan in order to allow convenient access to the diving pool and rainbow slide for Blossom East Line passengers coming from Loyalty Hills. Sun Fat is also modified to create a second set of platforms for trains to and from Loyalty Hills, given that the junction is north of the station.

According to "Lilac Light Rail Reform Plan 2023", route 719 is tentatively decided to inherit the color of [[lrt_721_2|route 721]], and route 719P will be using dark orange as its line color.
