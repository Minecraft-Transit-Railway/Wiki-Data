====== Let's Play Server ======

The Let's Play Server (Chinese: 齊齊玩伺服器) is a 1.19.2 Minecraft server owned and self-hosted by [[mtr:start|Minecraft Transit Railway]] mod creator [[/User:Jonafanho|Jonathan]], established in June 2022.

It uses the Minecraft 1.18+ terrain generation system, and uses  [[https://modrinth.com/mod/terralith|Terralith]] to make for a more varied landscape, using new biome variants. The beautiful scenery showcased in the overworld, in conjunction with the [[https://www.youtube.com/c/JonathanHo33|Let's Play Series on Jonathan's YouTube Channel]] has attracted large swathes of visitors.

Since 2022, the server has amassed over 100 lines, a wide cast of builders, an HSR network serving [[mtr_letsplay:spawn|Spawn]], [[mtr_letsplay:llanmara|Llanmara]], [[Kallos|Kallos]], [[mtr_letsplay:yankton|Yankton]], and the southwest through [[Danielston Memorial|Danielston Memorial]]. The longest journey between every two stations is expected to be less than 90 minutes((
The longest time between two stations by rail is from Spawn to Yongchun on the Intercity Metro-Diagonally Line, at 9 minutes and 3 seconds.

The server has a special version of the resource pack, so be sure to read the [[mtr_letsplay:modpack|]] if you want to play the server!
