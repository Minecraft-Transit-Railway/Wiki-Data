**Line 1 (Meyan Line) Phase 1** (Chinese: //一號 (美岩) 綫一期//), is a rapid transit service operated by [[/west_Lake_Transport_Authority|West Lake Transport Authority (WLT)]]. And **Line 1 (Meyan Line) N. Section Shuttle** (Chinese: //一號 (美岩) 綫󠄁北段特別穿梭//) is providing one-way southbound passengers service from [[/mesa_station|Mesa]] station to Northern Snow Village station. The name comes from being the first rapid transit line WLT has ever planned, with two future permanent termini Mesa station and [[/yanjiang_mineshaft_station|Yanjiang Mineshaft]] station. 

**Line 1 (Meyan Line) Phase 1** is currently 5.8 km long, starting from [[/northern_snow_village_station|Northern Snow Village]] station in [[/northern_snowland|Northern Snowland]], ending in [[/kwong_chow_station|Kwong Chow]] station in [[/west_lake_area|West Lake]] Area. The line connects up Northern Snowland, [[/sakura_stream_area|Sakura Stream]] Area and West Lake Area. 

Now sections from north Sakura Stream Area [[/hung_ngai_tung_station|Hung Ngai Tung]] station to Northern Snowland Area Northern Snow Village station are under renovation. Trains only run from Hung Ngai Tung station to Kwong Chow station. 

The line colour is <color #FFFFFF/#EB7AE9>orchid magenta</color> inspired from real life KCR West Rail and [[wp>West_Rail_line|West Rail Line]]((KCR West Rail has a pink line colour and West Rail Line has a dark magenta line colour, the two combined results in orchid magenta)).

===== History =====

The line is first proposed as a light rail service in the West Lake Area serving [[/chung_kwo_kok_station|Chung Kwo Kok]], Kwong Chow, [[/tai_po_station|Tai Po]], [[/chik_shek_wan_station|Chik Shek Wan]] and nearby rapid transit station Providence and [[/yanjiang_mineshaft_station|Yanjiang Mineshaft]]. It will branch off at Kwong Chow to serve the area at the east of West Lake, connect [[/red_leaves_station|Red Leaves]] as well.

Later, the branch is separated as another rapid transit line connecting [[/Spawn|Spawn]] area with Kwong Chow, via the east of West Lake, which is known as [[/wlt_line_2|WLT Line 2]].

The original light rail shuttle is also upgraded to a rapid transit line for future expansions. Sections between Chung Kwo Kok to [[/suet_yuen_station|Suet Yuen]] has also moved from surface or elevated to underground due to the deep underground level((Y = -44)) of platforms in Yanjiang Mineshaft.

Coincidentally, [[/shimanomtr|Shimano MTR]] starts it's operations and develops westward from Northern Snowland. The first line [[/shinx_line|Shinx Line]] starts service from 22 August, 2022 without any line connecting to other network. An extension from Providence to Northern Snow Village is filed and combined to the construction plan. Due to a more urgent need to make connections in the north, the construction of north extension part is built in advance of the south part.

After the north part connection is done, the main part starts construction. Along with the [[/kwong_chow_grand_canal|property development at Kwong Chow]], sections from Birch Hill to Kwong Chow is open on 22 December, 2022. The original **WLT Line 1** is also rebranded to **WLT Line 1 Phase 1** as the final termini and route of the line is confirmed and construction has begun.

Hung Ngai Tung station is done after 3 months and starts serving passengers. Meanwhile, the only service between [[/denthrope|Denthrope]] and Spawn Kowloon Commuter (now [[/hillside_line|Hillside Line]]) has been shut down by the operator [[/ERInc|ERInc]] for a while. Some R2C players complain they have to make a detour via [[/Llanmara|Llanmara]], and because of a lack of fast and direct service between Denthrope and Llanmara, they are disadvantageous comparing to other directions in similar radius. WLT offers to help by operating a special service southbound from Mesa station, close to Denthrope area, still WIP but able to open for events((Most electrical applainces except automatic platform gates and ticket barriers are not installed)). Although, when realized they are losing passengers, ERInc quickly resumes the service of Kowloon Commuter several hours later. Yet the travelling time on the temporary R2C service from Mesa station to Spawn station only takes 2 stops, 1 interchange and around 6-10 mins((Changing to [[/furret_line|Furret Line]] at Northern Snow Village station)), is still faster than Kowloon Commuter, given the starting point is not right at [[/denthrope_hauptbahnhof|Denthrope Hauptbahnhof]]. 

In 2023 July, the new update and server installation of NTE brings in changeable vertical radius and constant inclination which is important to WLT creating smoother train rides, changing speed on slopes and tweaking rail alignments. Since [[/wlt_line_2|WLT Line 2]] has already operated a special shuttle service between Kwong Chow and Sai Mo Island before, along with the new bus route 4S connecting Sai Mo Island to [[/spawn_-_cyan_heights_metropolis|Spawn-Cyan Height Metropolis]]((Temporary bus route which will be renamed to 4M and rerouted to serve Museum after Line 2 (Kwong Chow - North Coast Line) opens)), WLT Line 1 Phase 1 brings in the first service reduction after confirming alternatives are available. Mesa station and the sections until Northern Snow Village are closed for further construction, and the sections between Providence and Kwong Chow were also closed for renovation. Trains crossed over to upbound track, and turn back to Northern Snow Village after departing from Sakura Stream Junction and arriving at Providence. 

The sections from Providence station to Kwong Chow station reopens at the end of 2023. At the same time, Chung Kwo Kok station starts serving passengers. Sections between Northern Snow Village station and Hung Ngai Tung station had closed down before for switchover and another wave of renovation. 

Originally, the rename would be done when the line extends to Yanjiang Mineshaft. However, since WLT has opened up Mesa station a while for R2C special service, and provided a sneak peek at Yanjiang Mineshaft station, therefore, it is renamed to **Line 1 (Meyan Line) Phase 1** as to couple up the naming logic of three rapid transit lines together. 

As Denthrope Hauptbahnhof has been closed for renovation and has stopped all its train services since 20 November 2023, the transportation in the Denthrope area gets inconvenient again. Moreover, some players request to reopen [[/mesa_station|Mesa]] station to provide a faster and more direct way of southbound trains in West Denthrope. After some analysis, it is found that players can continuously get better off for a Mesa to Northern Snow Village connection even when Denthrope Hauptbahnhof finishes renovation and reopens. WLT reorganises the works on hand and quickly gets the trackage, sidings and schedules ready. **Line 1 (Meyan Line)** reopens Mesa station and runs trains to Northern Snow Village station as the **N. Section Temp Shuttle** starting from 16 January 2024.

===== Rolling Stocks =====

Because of the small turn radius((A lot of turns with radius less than 250m from Birch Hill station till Chik Shek Wan station)) in some sections in West Lake Area, Line 1 (Meyan Line) is never planning to run 25m 5-door trains. 21m 4-door trains are used as a balance of passengers load and ability to run on relatively small turn radius sections. 

Currently 15 sets of SP1900 Trains and 2 sets of MLR Trains are available for use and park in [[/chung_kwo_kok_depot|Chung Kwo Kok Depot]]. Since the expected usage of fleet will be keeping low at around 50%, a plan to install on-train passengers information system is announced. It is first decided to get reference from the MTR dynamic route map or Shenzhen Metro passenger information system above each door, but switched to utilize the TV as it allows larger font size, more information and tidier layouts. 

It is expected at least 13 more sets of SP1900 Trains and 1 more set of MLR Trains will arrive before Phase 2 opens. Finally, there will be 10 more sets of SP1900 Trains as the last batch, making up a fleet of 38 sets of SP1900 Trains and 3 sets of MLR Trains, for more frequent trains on the fully done Line 1 (Meyan Line).

===== Future Plans =====

Sections from Kwong Chow to [[/yanjiang_mineshaft_station|Yanjiang Mineshaft]] targets to open <del>in 2023 Q2</del> //2000 years later//. However, some information <del>from the rubbish bin of WLT temporary office at Spawn Tower 18/F</del> points out the section will open early depending on the progress.

In the meantime, the far north extension to Mesa is also WIP and is likely to open together with the forementioned section. 

The line will become one of the important, fast and convenient north-south connection at the west side. People can also enjoy single ride between [[/southern_snowland|Southern Snowland]] and Denthrope region.
