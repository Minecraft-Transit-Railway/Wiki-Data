**Hung Ngai Tung Station** (Chinese: //紅崖洞站//) is a station in the Sakura Stream Area built by [[mtr_community:staff:bdark000|BDark000]] on behalf of [[/west_lake_transport_authority|West Lake Transport Authority (WLT)]]. It is the temporary northern terminus of [[mtr_letsplay:wlt_line_1|Line 1 (Meyan Line) Phase 1]] before the renovation between [[/northern_snow_village_station|Northern Snow Village]] station and this station is done. It will become a mid-way stop of Line 1 (Meyan Line) afterwards. 

The literal meaning of the Chinese name means //Red Clift and Cave//, comes from the Siberian Taiga biome, clifty terrain and large lush cave near the station. The station also shares a very similar name to a tourist attraction in Chongqing also located at a clift //Hongyadong (洪崖洞)//, but it is just a coincidence.

===== History =====

This station is first proposed in the northern extension from [[/providence_station|Providence]] station to [[/northern_snow_village_station|Northern Snow Village]] as an additional mid-way stop. 

The station location is picked right at the clift, since tracks are flat when crossing the clift and a station building along the clift requires the least digging. For the structure to be strong enough against any possible landslide stress, the railway bridges have thick concrete pillars down to rock level. The materials of the pillars supporting the station structure, is chosen to be mangrove wood, as it fits the theme of the station. Special treatment preventing the wood loses its strength due to  insects biting or fungi corroding is done. 

**Hung Ngai Tung** station isn't expected to serve many passengers before nearby station developments are done. Also, since it requires more planning and preparation, the construction starts much later, after [[/kwong_chow_station|Kwong Chow]] station opens to the public. The construction finishes just on time and the opening of the station is promoted by [[/west_lake_transport_authority|WLT]] as the "gift of the Year of Rabbit".
==== Timeline ====
  * early September, 2022: The station location and design is confirmed. 
  * early January, 2023: As Kwong Chow station opens to the public and finishes construction, **Hung Ngai Tung** station starts construction. 
  * 11 February, 2023: Station opens to the public. WLT Line 1 Phase 1 (now [[/wlt_line_1|Line 1 (Meyan Line)]]) trains start stopping at this station for passengers service. 
  * early December, 2023: A small renovation on the stairs is done. Most of the staircases in the station are extended and leave a small space in the middle for better safety and passengers experience. Due to the staircases at Exit C being long, two spaces are added at around 1/3 and 2/3 of their length. 
  * 31 December, 2023: As the section between **Hung Ngai Tung** station and Northern Snow Village station is closed for renovation, incoming trains from the south only stop at platform 2 and then reverse back to the south. 
===== Layout (WIP) =====

Not counting exits, there are a total of 3 floors in the station. **L1** is concourse and is separated into north and south part not directly accessible to each other, due to [[/kwong_chow_grand_canal|the Grand Canal]] in between. North part connects Exit C, D while south part connects Exit A, B. **L2** and **L3** are platforms under the canal. 

Platforms 1, 3 stack on top of platforms 2, 4 on the two sides. In between is the core structure. Under the concourse on two ends, it consists of walls, passages, staircases and escalators. Under the canal, it has the famous high ceiling spacious and open design, with chandeliers hung between the pillars. To facilitate the interchange at the upper platforms, a passageway in the middle is built to further connect up platforms 1 and 3. And since future interchange between [[mtr_letsplay:wlt_line_1|Line 1 (Meyan Line)]] south of Kwong Chow and [[mtr_letsplay:wlt_line_2|Line 2 (Kwong Chow - North Coast Line)]] requires going down from upper platforms to lower platforms, a staircase and two escalators connecting the two floors are also built. 

One lift is serving between north concourse and the platforms, while another is serving between south concourse and the platforms. The lift serving south concourse is larger due to a higher anticipated passengers flow and capacity needed.
