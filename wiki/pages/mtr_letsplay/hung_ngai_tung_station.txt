**Hung Ngai Tung Station** (Chinese: //紅崖洞站//) is a station in the Sakura Stream Area built by [[mtr_community:staff:bdark000|BDark000]] on behalf of [[/west_lake_transport_authority|West Lake Transport Authority (WLT)]]. It is the temporary northern terminus of [[mtr_letsplay:wlt_line_1|Line 1 (Meyan Line) Phase 1]] before the renovation between [[/northern_snow_village_station|Northern Snow Village]] station and this station is done. It will become a mid-way stop of Line 1 (Meyan Line) afterwards. 

The literal meaning of the Chinese name means //Red Clift and Cave//, comes from the Siberian Taiga biome, clifty terrain and large lush cave near the station. The station also shares a very similar name to a tourist attraction in Chongqing also located at a clift //Hongyadong (洪崖洞)//, but it is just a coincidence.

===== History =====

This station is first proposed in the northern extension from [[/providence_station|Providence]] station to [[/northern_snow_village_station|Northern Snow Village]] as an additional mid-way stop. 

The station location is picked right at the clift, since tracks are flat when crossing the clift and a station building along the clift requires the least digging. For the structure to be strong enough against any possible landslide stress, the railway bridges have thick concrete pillars down to rock level. The materials of the pillars supporting the station structure, is chosen to be mangrove wood, as it fits the theme of the station. Special treatment preventing the wood loses its strength due to  insects biting or fungi corroding is done. 

**Hung Ngai Tung** station isn't expected to serve many passengers before nearby station developments are done. Also, since it requires more planning and preparation, the construction starts much later, after [[/kwong_chow_station|Kwong Chow]] station opens to the public. The construction finishes just on time and the opening of the station is promoted by [[/west_lake_transport_authority|WLT]] as the "gift of the Year of Rabbit".
==== Timeline ====
  * early September, 2022: The station location and design is confirmed. 
  * early January, 2023: As Kwong Chow station opens to the public and finishes construction, **Hung Ngai Tung** station starts construction. 
  * 11 February, 2023: Station opens to the public. WLT Line 1 Phase 1 (now [[/wlt_line_1|Line 1 (Meyan Line)]]) trains start stopping at this station for passengers service. 
  * early December, 2023: A small renovation on the stairs is done. Most of the staircases in the station are extended and leave a small space in the middle for better safety and passengers experience. Due to the staircases at Exit C being long, two spaces are added at around 1/3 and 2/3 of their length. 
  * 31 December, 2023: As the section between **Hung Ngai Tung** station and Northern Snow Village station is closed for renovation, incoming trains from the south only stop at platform 2 and then reverse back to the south. 
===== Layout =====

There are a total of 5 floors in the station. **U4** is platform and **U3** is concourse, along with exit A. Exit B is located two floors underneath the concourse at **U1**, the lowest floor of the station. Exit C is in a structure at the northwest of the station, from concourse level **U3** goes up to highest floor **U5** by a pair of long escalators and staircases adjacent. 

Platform layout is island platform. It makes the door opening direction different from the previous and next station Northern Snow Village and Sakura Stream Junction, allowing passengers to enter and exit the train at the less crowded side and hence improving efficiency. The island platform layout also requires fewer escalators, stairs and lifts to be built, saving construction costs. Openness in the middle part of the platform, as well as the tree kept in the platform level, is also one of the advantages of the adopted island platform design. 

Concourse is underneath the platform. It has extended outwards under the arch of railway bridge for more space putting in a lift and the customer service centre. Passengers can enjoy the view of the lake and the island nearby here. Ticket machine is put at the north and south side of the concourse, near exit C and the escalator to exit B, because of the space constraint. There is also a shop space reserved for a convenience store at the south side of the concourse, near the passageway to exit A. 

One lift is serving between the exits in the non-paid area at the south side, stopping at **U1**, **U3** and **U5**. The lift exit at U5 is assigned to a separate letter D as it is some distance away from the structure of exit C at the northwest side. Another lift is serving between concourse **U3** and the platform **U4**.
