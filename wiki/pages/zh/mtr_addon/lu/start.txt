====== The Tube ======
**The Tube** (previously known as **London Underground addon**) gives you the tools you need to make your own London Underground line using the power of the Minecraft Transit Railway Mod (which includes both the 1995/6 Tube Stock and D78 Stock trains).

The addon provides blocks to create Tunnels and Stations and station signage. Other great additions include a London Underground themed Platform Information Display and a red/green tunnel signal! There are also some great ambient sound effects to bring your tube stations to life!

The current version of the London Underground Addon for MTR is 1.11
