===== Version 1.X =====

The Version 1 Series ranges from **v1.0.0** to **v1.2.2** with 22 feature/compatibility update release in between.

As of **v1.2.2**, it is based on Architectury and supports Minecraft Fabric/Forge 1.16.5 - 1.20.1.

It is no longer being developed as development work moves on to v2.

===== Version 2.X =====

The Version 2 Series is a completely rewritten version of Joban Client Mod, with the version number starting from **v2.0.0**, with the hopes of being easier to maintain, add features, and be more lightweight.

It is based on the rewritten version of the [[https://github.com/Minecraft-Transit-Railway/Minecraft-Mappings|Minecraft Mappings]] project (Also used by MTR) to provide cross-version and modloader compatibility.

A beta version is available on Modrinth and GitHub, albeit with some missing blocks & features. The official release date is targeted to be the same as [[mtr:4.0.x|MTR 4.0.0]] if time allows.
