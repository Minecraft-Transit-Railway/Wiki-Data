====== 如何为MTR模组制作列车模型 ======

本指南将告诉您如何创建MTR模型。

===== 在我们开始之前 =====

MTR 模组利用 **Blockbench 模型 (BBMODEL)** 来适配大部分的列车模型。从MTR4开始，也可以为mod导入Wavefront OBJ模型，但不在本教程中教学。而且目前没有创建模型的实际标准或最佳实践；然而，本教程将教你如何基于内置模型创建模型。

===== 列车模型是怎样组成的？ =====

通常，列车由几个部分组成：

  - **车窗**: 车厢的窗户
  - **车门**: 车厢的门
  - **车头**: 有驾驶室的车头
  - **车尾**: 没有驾驶室的车尾

在大多数情况下，列车模型是由以下模式组成

  * 车头: 头部-(门&窗)-末端 
  *车箱: 末端-(门&窗)-末端 
  * 车尾: 末端-(门&窗)-尾部

Most trains will have a window part to be around 48 Blockbench units (3m) in length, and a door part to be around 32 Blockbench units (2m) in length. This makes the train to be able to align with the platform screen doors. The end part is usually around 16 Blockbench units to 20 units (1m to 1.25m) in length, so there is enough space for the train to take a turn.

Most trains' bodies will be 16 Blockbench units (1 metre) above ground to allow them to match the height of the platform, and have a width of around 40 to 44 Blockbench units (2.5 to 2.75m) so that the platform gap won't be too wide.

===== Initialisation =====

  * In the main menu, select **Modded Entity**.

<WRAP center round important 90%>

**ONLY** use the Modded Entity option. Other options will not work with MTR mod.

</WRAP>

  * Type in a file name. (!)

<WRAP center round important 90%>

**ONLY** use alphanumeric characters, 0-9, -, and _. CAPITAL LETTERS, special characters, white spaces, and other characters will not work.

</WRAP>

  * Click **Confirm**.

===== Building your model =====

For each part, repeat this process:

  * Create a folder (Ctrl + G) and give a meaningful name of what it is for, e.g,. "window".
  * You can now start building your model. Create a cube (Ctrl + N) and translate, rotate, and scale it to your liking.

==== Note ====

  - You can't scale a cube in decimal values. You have to scale it to integer values. However, you may use inflate to "scale" it to decimal values for certain parts, such as handrails.
  - Any rotation applied to a folder will be ignored. To rotate cubes in a folder, select all cubes in a folder, centre the pivot, and rotate.
