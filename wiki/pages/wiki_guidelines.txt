  - When possible, try to consolidate smaller tweaks into one larger edit. This helps to keep changelogs on the Wiki easy to digest and reduce the amount of spam that shows up in said changelogs. Do not spam edits.
  - Please make sure to create pages in the correct category.
  - Please keep language neutral
    * NO: //Tai Wo Hau is the best station in all of Hong Kong.//
    * YES: //Tai Wo Hau is the penultimate station on the Tsuen Wan Line in Hong Kong.//
  - Please include edit summaries describing changes made to the page you are editing. The box is found at the bottom of the page. 
    * BAD: //Added more information and images.//

  - Do not vandalise pages, including adding irrelevant and/or harmful images and text.
  - Users banned on the Discord server cannot edit on the Wiki. Bans are cross-honoured from Discord to Wiki.
  - Adopting the philosophy from Wikipedia, be as concise as possible, whilst still conveying ample amount of information. Pages should not be extensive biographies, but should be informational resources. Footnotes should be used for superfluous clarification.
  - Adopting the philosophy form Wikipedia, pages must not contradict one another. The community's view cannot simultaneously be "A" and "not A". Outside drama and superfluous indulgence in particular incidents is not permitted, and in any given case, Staff reserve the right to moderate and decide on a position should there by a point of disagreement.
  - All content must be in the third person perspective.

You are responsible for understanding and following these rules. Admins, Staff, and members of the Wiki Task Force  reserve the right to moderate at their discretion. We reserve the right to ban offenders, even those who follow the letter of the law but break the spirit of the law. The Wiki is ever-changing, and we reserve the right to change these guidelines at any time. An announcement will be made on Discord when the guidelines change.
