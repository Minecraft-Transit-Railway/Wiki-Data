====== Editing Guideline ======

===== Translating A Page =====

First, navigate to the page you want to translate, then choose the new language to translate from the sidebar, and click the "Create this page" button on the right.

The code of the page you want to translated should be copied over automatically. You can click the "Toggle syntax / visual editor" button to choose the editing method of your preference.

If your preferred language is not included, please contact the admins.

===== Creating A New Page =====

First, the page needs an English title like "Edit Guideline," then, you need to choose a category for the page to be in:

| mtr | The base MTR mod for the player |
| mtr_dev | Addon or resource pack development for MTR |
| mtr_letsplay | MTR Let's Play Server |
| mtr_addon->lu | The London Underground Addon |
| mtr_addon->nte | Nemo's Transit Expansion Addon |
| mtr_addon->msd | MTR Station Decoration Addon |
| playground | If you just want to try out the functions |

After you create the page, there will be a big box for you to enter text in and a bunch of icons on the top.

You can click the "Toggle syntax / visual editor" button to toggle between raw code editing and visual editing. Write the page title in the first line and make it "Heading 1" with the "H#" button (If you're using visual editor) or write it like "====== Page Title ======" (If you're using code editor, note that there must be 12 equal signs). You can use whatever language here in this title, not limited to English as in the page name.

After adding the header, you can write whatever you want in the following space.

You should write this new page in English. If you intend to write it in another language first, you can write a piece of text describing the situation, save it, and refer to the "Translating A Page" steps above.

If you happened to prefer using something called Markdown, you can enclose your Markdown content in %%<markdown></markdown>%%. Do note that Markdown isn't compatible with the visual editor.

For a full list of formatting options, you can look at the [[wiki:syntax|Syntax Guide]]
