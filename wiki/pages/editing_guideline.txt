====== Editing Guideline ======

===== Translating A Page =====

First, navigate to the page you want to translate, then choose the new language to translate from the sidebar, and click the "Create this page" button on the right.

The code of the page you want to translated should be copied over automatically. You can click the "Toggle syntax / visual editor" button to choose the editing method of your preference.

If your preferred language is not included, please contact the admins.

===== Creating A New Page =====

First, the page needs an English title like "Edit Guideline," then, you need to choose a category for the page to be in:

| mtr | The base MTR mod for the player |
| mtr_dev | Addon or resource pack development for MTR |
| mtr_letsplay | MTR Let's Play Server |
| mtr_extra | Community Resource Packs |
| mtr_addon->lu | The London Underground Addon |
| mtr_addon->nte | Nemo's Transit Expansion Addon |
| mtr_addon->msd | MTR Station Decoration Addon |
| mtr_community:server | Server pages for the Community |
| mtr_community:staff | Staff user pages |
| mtr_community:contributors | Contributor user pages |
| mtr_community:builders | Builder user pages |
| playground | If you just want to try out the functions |

After you create the page, there will be a big box for you to enter text in and a bunch of icons on the top.

You can click the "Toggle syntax / visual editor" button to toggle between raw code editing and visual editing. Write the page title in the first line and make it "Heading 1" with the "H#" button (If you're using visual editor) or write it like "====== Page Title ======" (If you're using code editor, note that there must be 12 equal signs). You can use whatever language here in this title, not limited to English as in the page name.

After adding the header, you can write whatever you want in the following space.

You should write this new page in English. If you intend to write it in another language first, you can write a piece of text describing the situation, save it, and refer to the "Translating A Page" steps above.

If you happened to prefer using something called Markdown, you can enclose your Markdown content in %%<markdown></markdown>%%. Do note that Markdown isn't compatible with the visual editor.

For a full list of formatting options, you can look at the [[wiki:syntax|Syntax Guide]]

===== Other Guidelines =====

For the [[wiki_guidelines|Wiki Guidelines]], please visit the corresponding page.

As per the new rules drafted 22 January 2024, adopted 27 January 2024, revised 29 January, taking affect 31 January 2024 at 02:00 HKT, server pages should no longer have the "Server -" prefix, as they now have their own sub-namespace under mtr_community, that being mtr_community:server. Please update your pages accordingly during the transitional period. Thereafter, Staff will change the namespaces for all pages organised incorrectly. The same rule applies to Staff, Contributor, and Builder user pages dropping the "User -" prefix and resource pack pages dropping the "Resource Pack -" prefix. Please review the above chart for where to correctly assign a page. 

Your user page should belong in the respective category according to the Staff > Contributor > Builder priority. If you have the orange Contributor role and you are a builder as well, your page should be placed in the Contributor namespace.

If you have any questions, please ask for help in the #wiki-discussion channel in [[https://discord.gg/xvTgJ3PbrP|Discord]]. As per the Wiki Guidelines, Admins and Staff reserve the right to modify any pages as necessary to fit the guidelines. Please make sure to check back on this page ever so often, as editing requirements may be added and/or changed. As stated above, we reserve the right to continue to make changes to the operations and guidelines of the Wiki as we see fit. We appreciate constructive feedback, and can/will make changes as time goes on.
