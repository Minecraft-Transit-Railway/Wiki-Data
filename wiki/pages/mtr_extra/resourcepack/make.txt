===== Guide =====

  - Go to your //.minecraft// folder. {{:mtr_extra:resourcepack:minecraft_folder.png?200&nolink}} 
  - Then find the //resourcepacks// folder {{:mtr_extra:resourcepack:screenshot_2023-05-16_211152.png?200&nolink}} 
  - Create a folder with a name that you want (for example: My custom M-Train) {{:mtr_extra:resourcepack:screenshot_2023-05-16_211341.png?200&nolink}}
  - Create a new folder inside of the existing folder called ''assets''. 
  - Upload a pack.png to your folder, this image will show in the resourcepack selection screen and should be 128x128.
  - Download this template pack.mcmeta and put it into your resourcepack folder:
<file json pack.mcmeta>
{
    "pack": {
        "description": "put your pack description here",
        "pack_format": 9,
    }
}
</file>

<WRAP center round info 60%>
The pack format is what version of Minecraft the pack is for. If you are only adding MTR models or textures, this is not important then.
</WRAP>


then create a new folder named MTR in the assets folder.
Create a text file inside the folder named ''mtr_custom_resources.json''

copy, paste & edit some of the values. The main code is here:

for one train:

<file json mtr_custom_resources.json>
{
	"custom_trains": {
		"{Base_Train_Name_here}": {
			"name": "My Custom Train Name",
			"color": "#66CCFF",
			"base_train_type": "sp1900",
			"texture_id": "mtr:{FOLDERNAME}/{TEXTURENAME}.png"

		}
	}
}
</file>

for more than one (here for 2 trains)
<file json mtr_custom_resources.json>
{
	"custom_trains": {
		"{Base_Train_Name_here}": {
			"name": "Another train name here",
			"color": "66CCFF",
			"base_train_type": "sp1900",
			"texture_id": "mtr:{FOLDERNAME}/{TEXTURENAME}.png"

		},
		
		"{Base_Train_Name_here}": {
			"name": "Another train name here",
			"color": "66CCFF",
			"base_train_type": "sp1900",
			"texture_id": "mtr:{FOLDERNAME}/{TEXTURENAME}.png"

		}
	}
}
</file>

**How to edit the textures?
**

  - go to [[https://github.com/jonafanho/Minecraft-Transit-Railway/tree/master/resources/common/normal/assets/mtr/textures/entity]] and download you´r wanted train texture
  - open Paint 3D and select Open (on Windows, on mac you can install any software that supports transparency)
  - go to you´r folder where you have saved the texture
  - start editing
  - after painting put the textures into you´r image folder in the RP
  - and you´re done!
