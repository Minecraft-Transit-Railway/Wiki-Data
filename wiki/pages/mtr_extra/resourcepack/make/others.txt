</WRAP>

===== Adding a sign =====

  * Go to your //.minecraft// folder. {{:mtr_extra:resourcepack:minecraft_folder.png?200&nolink}}

  * Then find the //resourcepacks// folder {{:mtr_extra:resourcepack:screenshot_2023-05-16_211152.png?200&nolink}}

  * Create a folder with a name that you want (for example: My custom signs) {{:mtr_extra:resourcepack:screenshot_2023-05-16_211341.png?200&nolink}}
  * Create a new folder inside of the existing folder called ''assets''.
  * Upload a pack.png to your folder, this image will show in the resourcepack selection screen and should be 128x128.
  * Download this template pack.mcmeta and put it into your resourcepack folder:

<code json pack.mcmeta>
{
    "pack": {
        "description": "put your pack description here",
        "pack_format": 9
    }
}
</code>

The pack format is what version of Minecraft the pack is for. If you are only adding MTR models or textures, this is not important. \\  However, if you feel the need to add a number, it is recommended to use 8 or 9, as they correspond to versions 1.18 and 1.19 respectively. \\  If a pack tells you it's "not compatible", just remember that the only thing that changes that is this number, so it really doesn't say much.

  * Create a new folder named ''mtr'' in the assets folder.

  * Create a text file inside the folder named ''mtr_custom_resources.json''

==== JSON files ====

The ''mtr_custom_resources.json'' defines all custom resources that you want to add. The template is provided below.

<code json mtr_custom_resources.json>
{
    "vehicles": [],
    "signs": [],
    "rails": [],
    "objects": [],
    "lifts": []
}
</code>

==== Adding your icon to the pack ====

  * Create a folder under ''mtr'' with a name that you want (for example: ''custom_signs'').

<WRAP center round important 90%>

Note that you can only use a-z, 0-9, - and _ for the folder name. CAPITAL LETTERS, white spaces and any other characters are **not acceptable.**

</WRAP>

  * Add in the custom icon that you wanted to use.

<WRAP center round info 90%>

Typically, an icon for signs is 128 x 128 in size.

</WRAP>

==== Registering the sign data ====

=== Compulsory components ===

  * Return to the ''mtr_custom_resources.json''. Inside the square brackets of ''"signs"'', add the following code.

<code json mtr_custom_resources.json>
{
	"id": "my_custom_sign",
	"textureResource": "mtr:custom_signs/custom_icon.png",
	"customText": "你好|Hello",
	"small": false,
	"flipCustomText": false
}
</code>

  * Replace the ''id'' to an ID that you like. Only a-z, 0-9, -, _ and ! are accepted.
  * Replace the ''textureResource'' with the path to the icon.

=== Optional components ===

  * Replace the ''customText'' with any text that you want to render. Use a vertical bar (|) to separate between two languages.
  * Set ''small'' to ''true'' if you want the icon to be rendered with a small padding around.
  * Set ''flipCustomText'' to ''true'' if you want the text to be rendered to the right.

  * Save the JSON file.

Please remember to validate your JSON file. Websites such as [[https://jsonlint.com/|JSONLint]] may be used to validate your JSON. Minecraft will **NOT** load any custom resources in a ''mtr_custom_resources'' that is invalid!

</WRAP>

==== Adding it to the game ====

  * Open Minecraft, and go to {{:mtr_extra:resourcepack:make:options.png?100}} > {{:mtr_extra:resourcepack:make:rp.png?160}} from either the Game Menu or the title page.
  * Apply the resource pack, and press {{:mtr_extra:resourcepack:make:done.png?160}}.
  * Your sign should now show in the game.
