====== How to add signs, sounds, etc. to your resource pack ======

This guide will tell you how to add signs, sounds, etc. to your resource pack.

<WRAP center round important 70%>

**MTR4 format** is used in this tutorial.

</WRAP>

In the MTR mod, it is possible to add your own custom signs, rails, objects and lift retextures by editing the ''mtr_custom_resources.json''.

==== Adding new custom content to the pack ====

  * Create a folder under ''mtr'' with a name that you want (for example: ''custom_signs'').

<WRAP center round important 90%>

Note that you can only use a-z, 0-9, - and _ for the folder name. CAPITAL LETTERS, white spaces and any other characters are **not acceptable.**

</WRAP>

  * Drop in the custom content that you will use.

===== Registering custom content =====
Return to the ''mtr_custom_resources.json''.
<tabbox Custom signs>
**Compulsory components**

<code json mtr_custom_resources.json>
{
	"id": "my_custom_sign",
	"textureResource": "mtr:custom_signs/custom_icon.png",
	"customText": "你好|Hello",
	"small": false,
	"flipCustomText": false
}
</code>

  * Replace the value of ''id'' with an ID that you like. Only a-z, 0-9, -, _ and ! are accepted.
  * Replace the value of ''textureResource'' with the path to the icon.

**Optional components**

  * Replace the value of ''customText'' with any text that you want to render. Use a vertical bar (|) to separate between two languages.
  * Set ''small'' to ''true'' if you want the icon to be rendered with a small padding around.
  * Set ''flipCustomText'' to ''true'' if you want the text to be rendered to the right.
<tabbox Custom rails>
**Compulsory components**

<code json mtr_custom_resources.json>
{
    "id": "my_custom_rail",
    "name": "My custom Rail",
    "color": "E5E533",
    "modelResource": "mtr:custom_rails/my_custom_rail.obj",
    "repeatInterval": 0.5
}
</code>

  * Replace the value of ''id'' with an ID that you like. Only a-z, 0-9, -, _ and ! are accepted.
  * Replace the value of ''name'' with a name that you like.
  * Replace the value of ''modelResource'' with a path to the model.
  * Replace the value of ''repeatInterval'' with the length of your model in metres.

**Optional components**
  * Replace the value of ''color'' with a HEX colour value that you like. This will change the colour of the small square next to the object to that value.
<tabbox Custom objects>
**Compulsory components**
Inside the square brackets of ''"objects"'', add the following code.
<code json mtr_custom_resources.json>
{
	"id": "my_custom_object",
        "name": "My custom object",
        "modelResource": "mtr:custom_objects/my_custom_object.obj",
        "textureResource": "mtr:custom_objects/my_custom_object.mtl",
        "color": "000000",
        "flipTextureV": true,
        "translation": [0,0,0],
        "rotation": [0,0,0],
        "scale": [1,1,1],
        "mirror": [false,false,false]
}
</code>

  * Replace the value of ''id'' with an ID that you like. Only a-z, 0-9, -, _ and ! are accepted.
  * Replace the value of ''name'' with a name that you like.
  * Replace the value of ''modelResource'' with a path to the model.
  * Replace the value of ''textureResource'' with a path to the model's texture.
  * Set ''flipTextureV'' to ''false'' if your texture is flipped.

**Optional components**
  * Replace the value of ''color'' with a HEX colour value that you like. This will change the colour of the small square next to the object to that value.
  * Modify the values of ''translation'', ''rotation'' and/or ''scale'' ([x,y,z]) if you want the model to be rendered by default to have that value of translation/rotation/scale.
  * Set ''mirror'' to ''true'' if you want the icon to be rendered with a small padding around.
<tabbox Custom lifts>
**Compulsory components**

<code json mtr_custom_resources.json>
{
	"id": "my_custom_lift",
        "name": "My custom lift",
        "color": "CCCCCC",
        "textureResource": "mtr:custom_lifts/my_custom_lift.png"
}
</code>
  * Replace the value of ''id'' with an ID that you like. Only a-z, 0-9, -, _ and ! are accepted.
  * Replace the value of ''name'' with a name that you like.
  * Replace the ''textureResource'' with the path to the lift texture.

**Optional components**
  * Replace the value of ''color'' with a HEX colour value that you like. This will change the colour of the small square next to the object to that value.
</tabbox>

Save the JSON file when you're done.

<WRAP center round important 90%>

Please remember to validate your JSON file. Websites such as [[https://jsonlint.com/|JSONLint]] may be used to validate your JSON. Minecraft will **NOT** load any custom resources in a ''mtr_custom_resources'' that is invalid!

</WRAP>

===== Adding it to the game =====

  * Open Minecraft, and go to {{:mtr_extra:resourcepack:make:options.png?100}} > {{:mtr_extra:resourcepack:make:rp.png?160}} from either the Game Menu or the title page.
  * Apply the resource pack, and press {{:mtr_extra:resourcepack:make:done.png?160}}.

===== Checking your custom content =====
To check whether your custom content has been added to the game, follow the instructions below.
==== Signs ====
Place down a sign, and scroll to the last page. Your custom sign should show.
==== Rails ====
Place down a rail, and use (right click) one of the rail node. Press ''Edit...'' and you should see your rail model.
