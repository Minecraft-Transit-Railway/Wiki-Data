===== Adding a sign =====
==== Adding your icon to the pack ====

  * Create a folder under ''mtr'' with a name that you want (for example: ''custom_signs'').

<WRAP center round important 90%>

Note that you can only use a-z, 0-9, - and _ for the folder name. CAPITAL LETTERS, white spaces and any other characters are **not acceptable.**

</WRAP>

  * Add in the custom icon that you wanted to use.

Typically, an icon for signs is 128 x 128 in size.

==== Registering the sign data ====

=== Compulsory components ===

  * Return to the ''mtr_custom_resources.json''. Inside the square brackets of ''"signs"'', add the following code.

<code json mtr_custom_resources.json>
{
	"id": "my_custom_sign",
	"textureResource": "mtr:custom_signs/custom_icon.png",
	"customText": "你好|Hello",
	"small": false,
	"flipCustomText": false
}
</code>

  * Replace the ''id'' to an ID that you like. Only a-z, 0-9, -, _ and ! are accepted.
  * Replace the ''textureResource'' with the path to the icon.

=== Optional components ===

  * Replace the ''customText'' with any text that you want to render. Use a vertical bar (|) to separate between two languages.
  * Set ''small'' to ''true'' if you want the icon to be rendered with a small padding around.
  * Set ''flipCustomText'' to ''true'' if you want the text to be rendered to the right.

  * Save the JSON file.

Please remember to validate your JSON file. Websites such as [[https://jsonlint.com/|JSONLint]] may be used to validate your JSON. Minecraft will **NOT** load any custom resources in a ''mtr_custom_resources'' that is invalid!

==== Adding it to the game ====

  * Open Minecraft, and go to {{:mtr_extra:resourcepack:make:options.png?100}} > {{:mtr_extra:resourcepack:make:rp.png?160}} from either the Game Menu or the title page.
  * Apply the resource pack, and press {{:mtr_extra:resourcepack:make:done.png?160}}.
  * Your sign should now show in the game.
