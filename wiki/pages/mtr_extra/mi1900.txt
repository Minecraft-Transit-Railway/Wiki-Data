The MI1900 and MI1900a are commuter/regional variants of the SP1900 included in the base mod. These featured 3 doors instead of 5, like the original MLRs. They have a fixed amount of cars, 4/8 for the MI1900 and 3/6/9/12 for the MI1900a.
They were the first true custom models coinc has done.

====== HIstory ======
The MI1900 was first published the 25 of June 2022 on the coinville DIscord server, as a train for the future RER line in Calais on the former Kingsburgh server.
It was submitted by form to be featured on the Community Works Discord channel but haven't got any response.
They went under testing in a short section between the depot and the Calais-Pont Huit station.

The MI1900a was released somewhere during September 2022 for the workers of the United Cities Railways server (back to this time Minecity) to replace the C1141A on the line E of the TER. This line, being a mix between a commuter and Intercity line, got more comfortable trainsets, with 3 cars per unit, the same amount as the current trains.
It was released with properties issues, where 9/12 cars trains would have parts not showing up, noclipping with others... For unknown reasons, the train never operated there.
====== Characteristics ======
Both the MI1900 and MI1900a have an outside livery based on the original MI79 and MI84 trainsets operating on the  [[wp>RER_B|Paris RER line B]]
However, their interior aren't based on those, but on the [[wp>SNCF_Class_Z_22500|MI2N Eole]] and [[wp>MI_2N|MI2N Alteo]] found on the lines E and A of the Paris RER.
The MI1900a features a more comfortable seats, to cope with the needs of commuters of this line, lacks the SIRTS logo and "Kingsburgh" writings.
Both feature transverse and longitudinal seats, with less facing seats for the MI1900a They also have luggage racks and bins.

====== A failure ? ======
Due to it's texture and properties issue, considering coinc1234 had past experience with MTR custom assets at this time (working on the DLR pack), seeing this train operated by others is very rare, as downloads for the pack are hard to find, hidden in other Discord servers. He attempted to make a remastered version in late June 2023 using the HD SP1900 from the IVR pack but his computer took several seconds at each save, making him give up.
More than a year after, they are now only running on the Seattle-Reazeug line of his singleplayer world and resting peacefully on the Calais sidings...

coinc1234 hasn't lost all hope, and is trying to find his past works to group them into a single resourcepack, Coincreations.
