**Ultimate Briddle Rail Pack (UBRP)** is a fictional resource pack that adds trains and ferries to Minecraft Transit Railway. Currently it has 4 trains and 2 ferries but will expand to have over 100.

===== History =====

==== The Trinsmoton Rail Pack ====

Although the **UBRP** was released on April 2024, it was first requested by X3N to Curt around October 2023 in a now defunct **Trinsmoton Test Server**, in which he needed a new train for his Whitecrest Regional services from that server. The pack was called "The Trinsmoton Rail Pack" and featured various trains that'll be in the **UBRP** including Class 80((
Now Class 400.
)), Class 100((
Now Class 300.
)), Class 250((
Now Class 320.
)), Class 251((
Now Class 420.
)), Class 190((
Now Class 330.
)), Class 191((
Now Class 430.
)), Class 418((
Now Class 318.
)) and the Class 420((
Now Class 720.
)).

==== Creation ====

The creation of **UBRP** dates all the way back to January 10th 2024, when Curt said he needed to remake the existing rolling stock to look less blocky. However, his lack of motivation keeps pushing the date back until April where he finally finished the remaking of Class 250 and Class 251 and the train classification numbers have been changed to Class 320 and 420 respectively.

===== Rolling Stock =====

==== Class 320 & Class 420 Commutra ====

The **Class 320 Commutra** is an AC Electric Multiple Unit that runs on the regional mainlines while the **Class 420 Commutra** is a DC Electric Multiple Unit that runs on high density commuter lines or short regional lines. Both trains are based on the [[wp>Alstom_Aventra|British Rail Alstom Aventra]] series of trains.

==== Class 400 Microelectric ====

The **Class 400 Microelectric** is a DC Electric Multiple Unit built for short commuter branch lines. They can be seen running as 3-car variants on low-density commuter lines. It is based on the [[wp>British_Rail_railbuses|British Rail Railbuses]].

==== Class 200 Runner ====

The **Class 200** is one of the first Diesel Electric multiple units to enter service and is used primarily on unelectrified regional services. It is based on the [[wp>British_Rail_Classes_445_and_446|Prototype Electro Pneumatic trains]] and the [[wp>Sprinter_(British_Rail)|British Rail Sprinters]].

==== Ferries ====

The ferries in **UBRP** are used for short-distance journeys between 1 station and another on water. They are not based on any ferries in real life.
