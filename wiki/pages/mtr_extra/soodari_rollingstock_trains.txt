Soodari Rollingstock Trains Resourcepack is a collection of [[mtr_extra:start|Resource Packs]] produced for [[mtr:start|Minecraft Transit Railway]] by Soodari, which began its released in the first half of 2023. Most trains in these RPs use the obj model, but initially started as a retexture for [[mtr:trains|existing trains]].

===== History =====

Since the second quarter of 2023, I have been releasing the obj model mainly, and I converted my models that originally used in other mod in the beginning, from the second half of 2023, there are more cases of making new models for this mod exclusively.

I've been uploading most RPs to modrinth since the [[https://addons.minecrafttransitrailway.com/#/|MTR Contents DB Pag]]e opened and the existing discord's community works channel went down. Some RPs haven't been uploaded to modrinth yet so I didn't delete onedrive download centre.

Starting Q4 2024, RP's MTR4-compatibility conversion work began. 
This can take some time due to the need for model renovation ,cleanup and editing Json stuff.

===== Features =====

These resourcepacks mainly deals with trains from the Asia-Pacific region, but can also find trains from some European and other continents.

Since most trains and structures use obj and capacity is quite large, it is recommended to modify JVM Arguments before RP installation. (Allocate 4~6GB or more is recommended)

===== Let's Play Server Uses =====

Trains and structures of this Resourcepack are in use on some lines of the [[mtr_letsplay:start|Let's Play Server]]. Most of them can be seen in the southwestern region, but a double decker tram can be found in [[mtr_letsplay:llanmara|Llanmara]].
